	   <b>Áqá Mírzá Áqáy-i-Afnán (Núru'd-Dín)</b><p>
	   This Tablet* was revealed in 1891 in honour of Áqá Mírzá Áqáy-Afnán, entitled Núru'd-Dín. His mother was a sister of Khadíjih Bagum, the wife of the Báb,† and Áqá Mírzá Áqá was born two years before His Declaration. In a Tablet to His wife revealed in the prison of Máh-Kú the Báb assures her that when Áqá Mírzá Áqá reaches the age of maturity he will be her helper and protector. These prophetic words of the Báb were fulfilled, for Áqá Mírzá Áqá dedicated his life to the service of his beloved aunt, whom he revered and served with unbounded devotion. Khadíjih Bagum lovingly taught him the Faith and at the age of thirteen Áqá Mírzá Áqá recognized the truth of the Mission of the Báb. It was through his efforts that Hájí Mírzá Siyyid Muhammad, the eldest maternal uncle of the Báb, went to meet Bahá'u'lláh in Baghdád and as a result became the recipient of the <i>Kitáb-i-Íqán</i> which assured him of the truth of the Báb's Revelation.<p>
	   Soon after His Declaration near Baghdád‡ Bahá'u'lláh sent Nabíl-i-A'zam to Persia to announce the momentous news to the Bábís. Nabíl went to the home of Áqá Mírzá Áqá, and announced the joyful tidings to the believers in Shíráz. Áqá Mírzá Áqá

	   immediately gave his allegiance to Bahá'u'lláh and considered himself a humble servant at His threshold. On one occasion the wife of the Báb, who was seated behind a curtain, heard Nabíl inform the friends that the Blessed Beauty was the Promised One of the Bayán, 'Him Whom God shall make Manifest'. No sooner did that noble woman hear this announcement than she put her forehead to the ground in adoration of her newly-found Lord and is reported to have whispered to her nephew: 'offer at His sacred threshold my most humble devotion.' Thus the bonds of love and adoration which had united these two became strengthened through their immediate response to the Cause they had both spontaneously espoused.<p>
	   From the early days Áqá Mírzá Áqá became the recipient of many favours and bounties from Bahá'u'lláh. The custodianship of the House of the Báb, which was conferred upon the wife of the Báb and her sister, also included him and his descendants.* In 1879 Áqá Mírzá Áqá moved to India and established a trading business in Bombay. A few years later, in 1887, he travelled to Egypt and Beirut where he stayed for some time in the home of his maternal uncle Hájí Mírzá Siyyid Hasan, known as Afnán-i-Kabír (the Great Afnán).† In Beirut he and his eldest son Áqá Siyyid Áqá‡ received permission to visit Bahá'u'lláh. They both attained His presence for the first time on the anniversary of the Báb's Declaration which that year coincided with 20 January 1888.§ Bahá'u'lláh bestowed unbounded blessings upon them. He is reported to have honoured them by ordering His servant to place a fur-lined overcoat on the shoulders of each as they were sitting in His presence. ø<p>

	   With Bahá'u'lláh's approval Áqá Mírzá Áqá and his eldest son proceeded to Port Said and established a business there. Each year he was permitted to go to the Holy Land where he attained the presence of Bahá'u'lláh. He went in 1889, 1890 and 1891. His last visit was the most memorable as he stayed for nine months and was accompanied by his family; they preceded him to Haifa and arrived on 17 July 1891 when Bahá'u'lláh was staying at the foot of Mount Carmel on his last visit to that spot. The party consisted of Áqá Mírzá Áqá's wife, four of their sons, and their only daughter. Áqá Mírzá Áqá himself joined his family fifteen days later when his eldest son returned to Port Said.<p>
	   One of his sons Hájí Mírzá Habíbu'lláh, who was then fifteen years of age, has recorded in his memoirs some interesting anecdotes of their pilgrimage. The following are extracts from his notes summarized and translated:<p>
	   <blockquote>
	   When the ship reached Haifa the very thought of prostrating ourselves at His threshold and attaining His presence which the Prophets and His chosen ones had wished to attain invoked such eagerness and excitement in our hearts that with tears streaming down our cheeks, we were transported into a different world. We arrived at a spot where the souls of all the Manifestations of God were circumambulating day and night around His Blessed Person. My eldest brother, Áqá Siyyid Áqá, who had previously attained the presence of Bahá'u'lláh, taught us how to conduct ourselves in that holy presence with absolute humility, servitude and utter self-effacement...<p>
	   I remember clearly that the sun had not yet fully risen, the air was fresh and vivifying as we were led to His Blessed tent which was pitched at the foot of Mount Carmel*...Our wish was truly fulfilled when our guide pushed the curtain aside and we beheld the most holy Figure of the Blessed Beauty standing in the middle of the room.†<p>

	   The house next door to that of the Blessed Beauty was rented for us, and we stayed in this close proximity of His luminous Person. Attaining His presence and meeting with the early believers made us forget everything else. It is impossible to describe the sweetness of life and the joy of our souls in those days.<p>
	   Fifteen days had passed when my eldest brother returned to Port Said and my father arrived. My father was the recipient of much blessing and bounty from Bahá'u'lláh. It was around that time that the news of the martyrdom of the seven martyrs of Yazd† reached there...<p>

A small house close to the Mansion was provided for us...From our house we could see the room of Bahá'u'lláh. When we arose at dawn for our devotions, we could often see His room lighted and His Blessed Person pacing up and down revealing verses, and Mírzá Áqá Ján taking down His words...In those days Mírzá Yúsuf Khán-i-Vujdání and Siyyid Asadu'lláh-i-Qumí were tutors to the Aghsán.‡ The Blessed Beauty instructed the three of us, Hájí Mírzá Buzurg, Hájí Mírzá Díyá and myself, to attend their lessons. The late Mishkín Qalam taught us calligraphy and one of the rooms on the ground floor of the Mansion was set aside as our classroom.<p>

With infinite joy we hastened to Him. He was coming toward our house with great majesty and grandeur. We all prostrated

I loved that rosary as my own life and have left it in the archives of the House of the Báb in Shíráz.<p>
	   As I have already mentioned, we could see the room of the Blessed Beauty from our house. I saw Him several times at the hour of dawn or in the early morning engaged in revealing verses of God. Often His Blessed Person was uttering words and Mírzá Áqá Ján was sitting in His presence. Usually Mírzá Áqá Ján had several pens* cut to a fine nib, with paper and ink ready at his side. The outpouring of the Word of God was swift, and billowed as a surging sea.<p>

One of the servants brought a chair for him. He then said, 'Bring chairs for his sons also.' So all of us sat on chairs.‡ All the resident believers and pilgrims were present.

After this the believers could be seen standing in small groups close to the Mansion near the pine trees, repeating the words of the Blessed Perfection to each other so as to commit them to memory.<p>
	   The next day, the 2nd of Muharram, which was the anniversary of the birthday of the One who is the Creator of the world and the Lord of mankind {Bahá'u'lláh}, all the pilgrims and resident Bahá'ís were summoned to His holy presence. That day He spoke about the greatness of His Revelation, the power of the Most Exalted Pen, the circumstances of His exile and His arrival at the Most Great Prison. He then spoke in great detail about the oppression and the persecution on the part of the tyrant enemies and divines...He stated that in spite of all the sufferings inflicted upon them by the government and the Sháh, the friends do not cease to demonstrate their allegiance to the Cause. They disregard wisdom and caution† and they are not to be blamed for this, because two great festivals have been combined together. He gave us the glad-tidings that the future of the Cause throughout the world would be very brilliant...When His utterances ended He distributed sweetmeats and we were dismissed from His presence.<p>

One of the local believers, Hájí Khávar, was a tall man. He walked alongside Bahá'u'lláh and held an umbrella over His head as a protection against the heat of the sun. The air was refreshing as we arrived in the garden...His Blessed Person was extremely happy that day and each one of the friends received his share of the bounties from His presence. We had lunch in the garden, then we assembled together and attained His presence.<p>
	   It was at that time that 'Abdu'l-Bahá arrived from 'Akká. The Blessed Beauty said, 'The Master is coming, hasten to attend Him'...On those days Bahá'u'lláh used to sow the seeds of loyalty and servitude toward 'Him whom God hath purposed' {'Abdu'l-Bahá} in the hearts of the believers and explained the lofty station and the hidden reality of the Master to all.<p>
	   Attended by everyone, 'Abdu'l-Bahá came with great humility into the presence of the Blessed Beauty. Then the Tongue of Grandeur uttered words to this effect, 'From morning until now this garden was not very pleasant, but now with the presence of the Master it has become truly most delightful.' Then, turning to the Master, He remarked, 'You should have come in the morning.' 'Abdu'l-Bahá responded, 'The Governor of 'Akká and some residents had requested to meet with Me. Therefore I had to receive and entertain them.' Bahá'u'lláh, with a smiling face, said, 'The Master is our shield. Everybody here lives in the utmost comfort and peace. Association with the outside people such as these is very, very difficult. It is the Master who stands up to everything, and prepares the means of comfort for all the friends.

On the day of their departure Maryam Sultán Bagum, the beloved wife of Áqá Mírzá Áqá, attained the presence of Bahá'u'lláh to pay her last homage to Him. She is reported to have kissed the hands of Bahá'u'lláh and made a wish that He might give her the ring He was wearing on His finger as a token of blessing for her family. She did not, however, express her wish. She then went to say farewell to the Greatest Holy Leaf, the daughter of Bahá'u'lláh.

	   The <i>Lawh-i-Dunyá</i> was revealed in Haifa, and a copy handed by Bahá'u'lláh to Hájí Mírzá Buzurg, the son of Áqá Mírzá Áqá in whose honour it was revealed. This Tablet dates from the time when the Hand of the Cause of God Mullá 'Alí-Akbar and the Trustee of Bahá'u'lláh, Hájí Abu'l-Hasan-i-Amín* were both imprisoned in Qazvín. Bahá'u'lláh bestows His bounties upon the two in the opening paragraph of this Tablet:<p>
	   <blockquote>

	   The 'mighty Prison' is the prison of Qazvín. As already mentioned earlier (p. 306) a group of political agitators were imprisoned by the Persian government in 1891. Three eminent Bahá'ís, Ibn-i-Abhar, Mullá 'Alí-Akbar and Hájí Amín were also cast into prison at the same time in order to appease the enemies of the Cause, by order of Kámrán Mírzá the Náyibu's-Saltanih, the Governor of Tihrán. The last two were put in chains and taken to the prison of Qazvín where they remained for eighteen months in chains and fetters;* afterwards they were transferred to the prison of Tihrán. Mullá 'Alí-Akbar was released after six months while Hájí Amín's imprisonment was prolonged further; he was released after the ascension of Bahá'u'lláh.<p>

God never advocates wrongdoing.

In doing so, he will find nothing but praiseworthy exhortations and divine guidance.<p>

He states that this can be achieved 'through a virtuous life and a goodly behaviour', reminds the believers that what ensures 'the triumph of this Cause' is a 'saintly character', forbids His loved ones 'to engage in contention or conflict', exhorts them 'to righteous deeds and praiseworthy character', admonishes them 'to observe courtesy' which He describes as 'the prince of virtues', and counsels them in these words:<p>

	   One of the distinguishing features of this great Revelation, which was not possible to achieve in previous Dispensations is the establishment of unity among people. Disunity has been and still is the hallmark of the old order. The Revelation of Bahá'u'lláh has vouchsafed to humanity the priceless gift of unity. These words are revealed in the <i>Lawh-i-Dunyá</i>:<p>
	   <blockquote>We have erewhile declared--and Our Word is the truth--: 'Consort with the followers of all religions in a spirit of friendliness and fellowship.' Whatsoever hath led the children of men to shun one another, and hath caused dissensions and divisions amongst them, hath, through the revelation of these words, been nullified and abolished. From the heaven of God's Will, and for the purpose of ennobling the world of being and of elevating the minds and souls of men, hath been sent down that which is the most effective instrument for the education of the whole human race...of old it hath been revealed: 'Love of one's country is an element of the Faith of God.' The Tongue of Grandeur hath, however, in the day of His manifestation proclaimed: 'It is not his to boast who loveth his country, but it is his who loveth the world.' Through the power released by these exalted words He hath lent a fresh impulse and set a new direction to the birds of men's hearts, and hath obliterated every trace of restriction and limitation from God's holy Book.<small><sup>4</sup></small></blockquote>
	   In many of His Tablets Bahá'u'lláh has admonished His loved ones to protect themselves against the influence exerted by the wicked and the ungodly. 'Eschew all fellowship with the ungodly' <small><sup>5</sup></small> is Bahá'u'lláh's counsel in His <i>Hidden Words</i>. In the <i>Lawh-i-Dunyá</i> Bahá'u'lláh clearly defines who the ungodly are. 'The Evil One', He states, 'is he that hindereth the rise and obstructeth the spiritual progress of the children of men.' <small><sup>6</sup></small><p>

	   In this Tablet Bahá'u'lláh promulgates some of His Teachings aimed at the reconstruction of human society. These mostly reiterate teachings previously revealed, such as the establishment of an international language, promotion of fellowship among all peoples, and the education of children. He attaches great importance to agriculture, recommends the establishment of constitutional government, condemns the actions of the 'unbelievers and the faithless'--an allusion to the enemies of the Faith in Persia--who 'have set their minds' on 'the shedding of blood', 'the burning of books', 'the shunning of the followers of other religions' and 'the extermination of other communities and groups'. He reproaches the Shí'ah sect of Islám for their 'foul imprecations' when they 'invoke the word <i>Mal'ún</i> (accursed)--uttered with a guttural sound of the letter <i>ayn'</i>.* He beseeches God, however, to 'guide aright' these people, and 'to purge them of unseemly conduct'.<p>
	   He further expresses astonishment at the people of Persia, for it was reported to Him that 'a certain person went to the seat of the imperial throne in Persia and succeeded in winning the good grace of some of the nobility by his ingratiating behaviour'. This is a reference to Siyyid Jamálu'd-Din-i-Afghání, a brief outline of whose notorious activities is given elsewhere in this book.†<p>

By doing so, not only has the clergy put a curse on someone, but by pronouncing the letter 'U' with a guttural sound he proudly puts himself in the category of a scholar of the Arabic language. Thus he makes a great impression upon the untutored multitude who never know how to use a guttural sound and are lost in admiration for one who does.<p>

	   In the <i>Lawh-i-Dunyá</i> Bahá'u'lláh again pays tribute to those men of learning who are detached from the things of this world and engaged in the guidance of other souls. He bestows His blessings upon them in these words:<p>
	   <blockquote>O people of God! Righteous men of learning who dedicate themselves to the guidance of others and are freed and well guarded from the promptings of a base and covetous nature are, in the sight of Him Who is the Desire of the world, stars of the heaven of true knowledge. It is essential to treat them with deference. They are indeed fountains of soft-flowing water, stars that shine resplendent, fruits of the blessed Tree, exponents of celestial power, and oceans of heavenly wisdom.

	   Hájí Muhammad-Ridá was originally from the province of Khurásán, but lived in Isfahán and worked as a merchant. He was a devoted believer and a very active teacher of the Cause. Because of his teaching activities he was put in prison, but was released after some time. He then left Isfahán and eventually went to 'Akká and attained the presence of Bahá'u'lláh. Coming into contact with the Person of Bahá'u'lláh was the cause of igniting within his heart the fire of love and devotion for his Lord. He begged Him to accept him as a martyr and enable him to lay down his life in His path. Bahá'u'lláh is reported to have told him that it was not necessary, as many souls had already sacrificed their lives in His path. But Hájí Muhammad-Ridá was so intoxicated with the wine of Bahá'u'lláh's presence that he wanted to give his all to his Beloved. So he repeated his plea. This time the Blessed Beauty remained silent and he took it as a sign of consent. Later he asked Bahá'u'lláh to assign for him a city to reside in. He was bidden to proceed to 'Ishqábád. He lived there for several years and was engaged in teaching the Cause among the Muslim population.<p>
	   On 1 July 1889 Hájí Muhammad-Ridá received a Tablet<small><sup>10</sup></small> from Bahá'u'lláh in which He praises him for his devoted services, bestows His blessings upon him for his steadfastness and devotion to the Cause, and assures him that all his deeds and aspirations are manifest before Him. He further states that a grievous upheaval has occurred in the city of Ishqábád and describes it as the attack of a serpent upon one who is the recipient of the bounties of His Lord.<p>
	   Although the identity of the believer who was the target is not disclosed by Bahá'u'lláh, He prays for Hájí Muhammad-Ridá that God may give strength to his body and assurance to his heart. This Tablet arrived at a time when Hájí Muhammad-Ridá had invited all the believers of 'Ishqábád to a feast. When it was read out to the friends, Mírzá Abu'l-Fadl explained that although

	   no upheaval had taken place so far in 'Ishqábád, since Bahá'u'lláh has used the past tense and clearly indicated that one of the believers had been struck down by the enemies, it was an absolute certainty that this upheaval was inevitable. It would happen soon and only one person would be martyred. Hájí Muhammad-Ridá said to the friends that he believed that he was the believer whose martyrdom Bahá'u'lláh had foretold in this Tablet. And this happened two months later.<p>
	   Incensed by the remarkable progress of the Faith in 'Ishqábád, the Shí'ah Muslim community had been secretly planning to assassinate a number of believers. Although their plan did not materialize, they succeeded in murdering Hájí Muhammad-Ridá. Two men armed with daggers attacked him in the bazaar and stabbed him to death. This was on the morning of 8 September 1889. It is reported that they stabbed him thirty-two times amid the jubilation of a great number of people who had gathered to watch him die. Some of the believers attributed the prayers revealed by Bahá'u'lláh in the Tablet he had received, which beseeched God to give strength to his body, as an indication of the agonizing and torturous way in which he was to be martyred. The murderers were so bloodthirsty that they were seen licking their daggers which were dripping with blood, until the Russian police arrived and took them into custody.<p>
	   On discovering the plot, which had been intended to kill a number of prominent Bahá'ís, the believers sent a petition to General Komaroff, the Governor-General of Transcaspia, and appealed for protection. This was granted to them and in this way the enemies' plans were frustrated. A prolonged investigation was conducted in the law courts where, in the presence of spectators, many Bahá'ís and non-Bahá'ís were questioned. At the end the court delivered the verdict of guilty and sentence was pronounced. The two murderers were to be executed by hanging, and a few men accessory to the crime were to be exiled to Siberia. This was the first time in the history of the Faith that those responsible for killing a Bahá'í had been brought to justice. The verdict infuriated the Shí'ah clergy in Persia, who were in the

	   In the meantime, while the prisoners were behind bars awaiting their execution, a number of their relatives accompanied by a few leading merchants visited some prominent Bahá'ís and begged them to intercede with the government for the commuting of the death sentence. The Bahá'ís held a meeting, consulted and decided to take action. Mírzá Abu'l-Fadl and another believer made representations to the Governor on behalf of the Bahá'í community and interceded with the government, in the first place to absolve the murderers of their crime, and if not possible to mitigate their sentences. The Governor was deeply impressed by the attitude of the Bahá'ís and their willingness to forgive the assassins.<p>
	   This request was passed on to the Czar, who approved the commuting of the sentences. But the decision was kept a secret and only revealed dramatically at the last moment. On the execution day gallows were erected and graves dug. The prisoners dressed in white robes and ready for execution were brought out of the prison and led to the scaffold. When the moment arrived a government official, in the presence of great multitudes, read out a proclamation announcing that as a result of the intercession of the Bahá'ís with the government requesting pardon for their enemies, His Majesty the Czar had commuted the sentences of the two murderers to life imprisonment in Siberia, and halved the sentences of the others.<p>
	   This act of intercession on behalf of their enemies was acclaimed by Bahá'u'lláh as a princely deed. It brought great satisfaction to His heart that through His counsels and exhortations for well-nigh forty years, the believers had at last risen to such heights of faith as to intercede for the release of those who were their deadly enemies.<p>

	   He was Prince Mahmúd Mírzá the Jalálu'd-Dawlih, Governor of Yazd. Bahá'u'lláh is referring to the martyrdom on his orders of seven believers known as the first seven martyrs of Yazd. This heinous crime took place on 19 May 1891; the news reached Bahá'u'lláh when He was staying in Haifa. He withheld the Revelation of His words for nine days, and during this period no one was admitted into His presence. The first Tablet which was revealed after this lapse of nine days was the <i>Lawh-i-Dunyá</i>. The details of the martyrdom of these seven is given in the <i>Táríkh-i-Shuhadáy-i-Yazd</i> (the History of the Martyrs of Yazd), and Shoghi Effendi in his masterly fashion has summarized it as follows:<p>
	   <blockquote>In Yazd, at the instigation of the mujtahid of that city, and by order of the callous Mahmúd Mírzá, the Jalálu'd-Dawlih, the governor, a son of Zillu's-Sultán, seven were done to death in a single day in horrible circumstances. The first of these, a twenty-seven year old youth, 'Alí-Asghar, was strangled, his body delivered into the hands of some Jews who, forcing the dead man's six companions to come with them, dragged the corpse through the streets, surrounded by a mob of people and soldiers beating drums and blowing trumpets, after which, arriving near the Telegraph office, they beheaded the eighty-five year old Mullá Mihdí and dragged him in the same manner to another quarter of the city, where, in view of a great throng of onlookers, frenzied by the throbbing strains of the music, they executed Áqá 'Alí in like manner. Proceeding thence to the house of the local mujtahid, and carrying with them the four remaining companions, they cut the throat of Mullá 'Alíy-i-Sabzivárí, who had been addressing the crowd and glorying in his imminent martyrdom, hacked his body to pieces with a spade, while he was still alive, and pounded his skull to a pulp with stones. In another quarter, near the Mihríz gate, they slew Muhammad-Báqir, and afterwards, in the Maydán-i-Khán, as the music grew wilder and drowned the yells of the people, they beheaded the survivors who</blockquote>

The stomach of the latter was ripped open and his heart and liver plucked out, after which his head was impaled on a spear, carried aloft, to the accompaniment of music, through the streets of the city, and suspended on a mulberry tree, and stoned by a great concourse of people. His body was cast before the door of his mother's house, into which women deliberately entered to dance and make merry. Even pieces of their flesh were carried away to be used as a medicament. Finally, the head of Muhammad-Hasan was attached to the lower part of his body and, together with those of the other martyrs, was borne to the outskirts of the city and so viciously pelted with stones that the skulls were broken, whereupon they compelled the Jews to carry the remains and throw them into a pit in the plain of Salsabíl. A holiday was declared by the governor for the people, all the shops were closed by his order, the city was illuminated at night, and festivities proclaimed the consummation of one of the most barbarous acts perpetrated in modern times.<small><sup>12</sup></small></blockquote>
	   Some years later in 1903 a great massacre of the Bahá'ís took place in Yazd during the governorship of the same Jalálu'd-Dawlih. He tried hard to avert the catastrophe but his soldiers and officials failed to suppress the convulsions caused by the clergy. He lost control for a few days and many Bahá'ís in the city and neighbouring townships and villages were martyred in the most horrible circumstances. When 'Abdu'l-Bahá was in London, Jalálu'd-Dawlih, then living in exile, came in a state of dejection to see Him. Apparently penitent for his past crimes, he threw himself at 'Abdu'l-Bahá's feet, but the Master, who did not wish to see him humiliated, immediately made him feel at ease in His presence.<p>

In the opening paragraph Bahá'u'lláh states that the martyrdom of the seven and the imprisonment of the two have created the most joyous jubilation among the Concourse on High. He describes in glowing terms the festive mood among the inmates of the highest paradise as they rejoice and celebrate with exceeding gladness the victory of the triumphant martyrs over their adversaries. Neither the onslaught of the bloodthirsty tyrant nor the fury of the beastly oppressor had succeeded in dampening their faith and enthusiasm or extinguishing the fire of the love of their Lord within their hearts. Their steadfastness in the face of such brutal treatment had endowed the Faith with enormous potentialities.<p>
	   In this Tablet Bahá'u'lláh describes the circumstances of the martyrdom of the seven in detail, and recounts the story of each. Of Mullá 'Alíy-i-Sabzavárí, one of the seven, Bahá'u'lláh says that this great man of God proclaimed the Cause of God at the very moment of martyrdom, and testified to its truth with his own life-blood. Just before he was beheaded, he cried aloud to the teeming multitudes who had assembled around him, these soul-stirring words: 'At the time of his martyrdom on the plane of Karbilá, Imám Husayn, the Prince of Martyrs, called out to those around him: "Is there any one capable of helping, to help me." And I say to you: Is there any one capable of beholding, to behold me!'* Bahá'u'lláh showers His praise and blessings upon him for these words.<p>
	   This Tablet is significant for its portrayal of the sufferings and persecutions which the people of Persia inflicted upon the believers. Only a small part of this Tablet to <i>The Times</i> has so far been translated into English:<p>
