	   <center><h2>The <i>Kitáb-i-Badí'</i></h2></center><p>
	   The <i>Kitáb-i-Badí'</i> is Bahá'u'lláh's apologia written in defence of His Faith and to demonstrate the validity and the truth of His Own Mission. It is mainly in Persian, but also contains many passages in Arabic. This book may be regarded in the same light as the <i>Kitáb-i-Íqán</i>, in which Bahá'u'lláh establishes the authenticity and truth of the Message of the Báb. A contrasting feature of these two books is that, whereas the <i>Kitáb-i-Íqán</i> was addressed to the Báb's illustrious uncle* who as a result of reading it became illumined by the light of faith and acknowledged the truth of the Cause of God, the <i>Kitáb-i-Badí'</i> was addressed to the notorious Mírzá Mihdíy-i-Gílání, a so-called Bábí and a man of perfidy and hypocrisy. It was revealed in response to several venomous comments which he had made in a letter to one of the companions of Bahá'u'lláh. In the early days of the Faith, Mírzá Mihdí had entered the fold of the Bábí community in Tihrán and was a close friend of Áqá Muhammad-'Alíy-i-Tambákú-Furúsh. Mírzá Mihdí, however, was known among the Bábís as a man who lived an impious life and whose deeds were contrary to the teachings of God.<p>
	   When Hájí Mírzá Haydar-'Alí was preparing to go to Adrianople, Mírzá Mihdí decided to accompany him. They were both in Tihrán at the time. The former at first agreed, but then refused to travel with him when he observed Mírzá Mihdí's reprehensible conduct and attitude. They parted company and Mírzá Mihdí went on his own to Constantinople, but not to Adrianople. Hájí Mírzá Husayn Khán, the Persian

	   Ambassador in Constantinople, was impressed by Mírzá Mihdí and appointed him as the judge of the Persian Shí'ah community in the capital. It was at this juncture in his life that he came in contact with Siyyid Muhammad-i-Isfahání who had gone to Constantinople to stir up trouble for Bahá'u'lláh and His companions.<p>
	   As a result of this association a new chapter opened in the life of Mírzá Mihdí. As a corrupt and arrogant mischief-maker himself, he discovered in Siyyid Muhammad an affinity and likeness which soon resulted in his becoming an ardent follower and a willing tool. Under the guidance of his newfound teacher, he learned new lessons in intrigue, became acquainted with those misrepresentations and lies which characterized the activities of Siyyid Muhammad, and arose in enmity and opposition to Bahá'u'lláh.<p>
	   At the instigation of Siyyid Muhammad, Mírzá Mihdí wrote a letter to his old friend Áqá Muhammad-'Alíy-i-Tambákú-Furúsh who was one of Bahá'u'lláh's companions in Adrianople. This venomous letter, loaded with calumnies against Bahá'u'lláh, was obviously written with the help of Siyyid Muhammad, and probably composed by him. Most of its arguments were aimed at proving the falseness of the claims of Bahá'u'lláh to be 'He Whom God shall make manifest', the One promised by the Báb. Not only were his objections utterly false themselves, but some of them were couched in discourteous language and were disrespectful to Bahá'u'lláh.<p>
	   Áqá Muhammad-'Alí, to whom this letter was addressed, was a devoted companion of Bahá'u'lláh. We have already stated* that he had accompanied Bahá'u'lláh from Baghdád to Constantinople and Adrianople, and he was also among those who later journeyed with Him to 'Akká. He was a man who enjoyed a good life in spite of the hardships and privations suffered during these banishments. Of him 'Abdu'l-Bahá writes:<p>

	   ...he had little to live on, but was happy and content. A man of excellent disposition, he was congenial to believers and others alike...In Adrianople as well, his days passed happily, under the protection of Bahá'u'lláh. He would carry on some business which, however trifling, would bring in surprisingly abundant returns...<p>
	   He spent his days in utter bliss. Here,* too, he carried on a small business, which occupied him from morning till noon. In the afternoons he would take his samovar, wrap it in a dark-coloured pouch made from a saddle-bag, and go off somewhere to a garden or meadow, or out in a field, and have his tea. Sometimes he would be found at the farm of Mazra'ih, or again in the Ridván Garden; or, at the Mansion, he would have the honour of attending upon Bahá'u'lláh.<p>
	   Muhammad-'Alí would carefully consider every blessing that came his way. 'How delicious my tea is today,' he would comment. 'What perfume, what colour! How lovely this meadow is, and the flowers so bright!'  He used to say that everything, even air and water, had its own special fragrance. For him the days passed in indescribable delight. Even kings were not so happy as this old man, the people said. 'He is completely free of the world,' they would declare. 'He lives in joy.' It also happened that his food was of the very best, and that his home was situated in the very best part of 'Akká. Gracious God! Here he was, a prisoner, and yet experiencing comfort, peace and joy.<small><sup>1</sup></small><p>

	   Áqá Muhammad-'Alí had a great sense of humour and was a delightful companion to Bahá'u'lláh. Once in 'Akká Bahá'u'lláh attended a memorial meeting for one of the believers who had died. Áqá Muhammad-'Alí was present. He noticed how the bounties of Bahá'u'lláh and His loving-kindness were being showered upon the soul of the deceased. Longing for the same treatment, he is reported  to have said to Him, 'I shall be honoured if you would presume that I am dead also, and give me the privilege of inviting you to attend a memorial meeting

	   As soon as he read Mírzá Mihdí's distasteful letter, Áqá Muhammad-'Alí took it to Bahá'u'lláh. The <i>Kitáb-i-Badí'</i> was written to refute the accusations of Mírzá Mihdí. Bahá'u'lláh revealed this book on three successive days. Each day He dictated for about two hours and Áqá Muhammad-'Alí took the words down. We have stated previously* that while some of Bahá'u'lláh's Writings appear to have been composed by his amanuensis Mírzá Áqá Ján, yet every word was dictated by Bahá'u'lláh Himself. The <i>Kitáb-i-Badí'</i> is a similar case. Although it is written in the words of Áqá Muhammad-'Alí, in fact it is revealed by Bahá'u'lláh from beginning to end.<p>
	   This book, almost twice the size of the <i>Kitáb-i-Íqán</i> and written in defence of the Faith of Bahá'u'lláh, occupies a significant position among His Writings. It gives the reader remarkable insight into the prophecies of the Báb concerning 'Him Whom God shall make manifest', and clearly demonstrates that the advent of the Revelation of Bahá'u'lláh was the ultimate aim of the Báb and the fulfilment of all that He had cherished in His heart. The book exerted a great influence upon the members of the Bábí community, especially those who were confused and vacillating. It resolved many of their doubts and perplexities and enabled them to recognize the exalted station of Bahá'u'lláh as 'He Whom God shall make manifest'. For those who are well versed in the Writings of the Báb, this book may be regarded as a key to many of the mysteries which are to be found in the Revelations of the Báb and Bahá'u'lláh. It is one of the most challenging works of Bahá'u'lláh, written with forcefulness and clarity. It also gives an account of some of Bahá'u'lláh's teachings as well as some aspects of the history of His Cause. One of its outstanding features is the way in which Bahá'u'lláh refutes the objections and accusations of Mírzá Mihdí with such convincing proofs

	   that the reader becomes utterly overwhelmed by the irrefutable power of His reasoning.<p>
	   There is no doubt that the <i>Kitáb-i-Badí'</i> shattered the idle fancies of the breakers of the Covenant of the Báb who had sought assiduously to undermine the Faith of Bahá'u'lláh through the dissemination of misleading and untrue reports. The arguments put forward by Mírzá Mihdí were feeble and misguided. They contained many false statements, misrepresentations and lies which originated from Siyyid Muhammad.<p>
	   The manner in which the <i>Kitáb-i-Badí'</i> is revealed is such that Bahá'u'lláh quotes a few lines from the letter of Mírzá Mihdí and then reveals pages in reply. He continues in this way until all points and accusations embodied in the letter are fully answered.  A remarkable feature of these answers is the compelling vigour of Bahá'u'lláh's pronouncements. So powerful are His words that Mírzá Mihdí seems like a puny bird held in the claws of a mighty falcon and reduced to utter nothingness. The force of Bahá'u'lláh's arguments, the clarity of His explanations, the profundity of His utterances, are matched only by His all-encompassing knowledge of the Writings of the Báb which He quotes profusely in support of His theme. And this in spite of the fact that, as He Himself attests,* He had not read everything from the Writings of the Báb, including the Bayán! This is an evidence of His divine knowledge.<p>
	   In the <i>Kitáb-i-Badí'</i>, Bahá'u'lláh at times uses very strong language in condemning the actions of Mírzá Mihdí and his master, Siyyid Muhammad. Mírzá Mihdí is denounced as the 'wicked one', 'the evil plotter', 'the impious', 'the impudent', 'the outcast', 'the faithless soul', 'the froward', 'he who contends with God', 'one from whose pen had flowed what caused the Báb to lament in the Kingdom and with Him the souls of all the chosen ones of God'. Repeatedly, Bahá'u'lláh calls on him to withhold his pen and warns him that God, through His wrath, will soon strike him down. Indeed, it was not long before Mírzá Mihdí died.

	   <i>Lawh-i-Fu'ád</i>* where He describes the tormenting agony of his soul when the wrathful vengeance of God descended upon him. There are also many passages in the <i>Kitáb-i-Badí'</i> in which Siyyid Muhammad is stigmatized in such terms as the 'one who joined partners with God', 'the prime mover of mischief', 'the embodiment of wickedness and impiety', and 'one accursed of God'. That Bahá'u'lláh addressed these men in such strong language is indicative of His supreme authority as the Judge and Ruler of mankind. Let us ponder upon the power of the Manifestation of God. He, and He alone, can reveal all the attributes of God to man, and one of God's attributes is His wrath. It is through the operation of this attribute that God casts out those who rise up to oppose Him.<p>
	   From the study of the Writings of Bahá'u'lláh it becomes clear that God's mercy and forgiveness overshadow the whole of creation. Through these attributes God has vouchsafed His protection to humanity. If it were not for His mercy and grace, no man could survive the operation of His justice. The loving and forgiving God overlooks the sins and shortcomings of man, immerses him in the ocean of His mercy and, without his deserving, bestows upon him everlasting life. But when a person breaks His Covenant and consciously rebels against the One who manifests Him, then His wrath is invoked and the soul of that individual becomes deprived of the bounties of God. Siyyid Muhammad and Mírzá Mihdí were of this category, and Bahá'u'lláh, in denouncing them, is doing no more than revealing the true condition of their souls. An important point to bear in mind, however, is that no man has the vision or the authority to condemn another soul. It is solely the function of the Manifestation of God and those upon whom He confers infallibility and authority.<p>

	   <b>Condemnation of the Covenant-breakers</b><p>
	   The <i>Kitáb-i-Badí'</i> is also replete with passages in condemnation of the centre of rebellion, Mírzá Yahyá. Bahá'u'lláh refutes his claims to be the appointed successor of the Báb and quotes numerous passages from the Writings of the Báb in support of His arguments. He makes it very clear that the only thing which the Báb promised to His followers was the advent of the Revelation of 'Him Whom God shall make manifest'. Since Mírzá Yahyá was one of the 'Mirrors' of the Bábí Dispensation*--and he used to employ this title to impress the followers of the Báb--Bahá'u'lláh clarifies the position of the 'Mirrors'. He quotes many statements of the Báb that the 'Mirrors' had no light of their own, that their radiance depended upon their turning to the source of light, 'Him Whom God shall make manifest'. The Báb reveals:<p>
	   <blockquote>He†--glorified be His mention--resembleth the sun. Were unnumbered mirrors to be placed before it, each would, according to its capacity, reflect the splendour of that sun, and were none to be placed before it, it would still continue to rise and set, and the mirrors alone would be veiled from its light. I, verily, have not fallen short of My duty to admonish that people, and to devise means whereby they may turn towards God, their Lord, and believe in God, their Creator. If, on the day of His Revelation, all that are on earth bear Him allegiance, Mine inmost being will rejoice, inasmuch as all will have attained the summit of their existence, and will have been brought face to face with their Beloved, and will have recognized, to the fullest extent attainable in the world of being, the splendour of Him Who is the Desire of their hearts. If not, My soul will indeed be saddened. I truly have nurtured all things for this purpose. How, then, can anyone be veiled from Him? For this have I called upon God, and will continue to call upon Him. He, verily, is nigh, ready to answer.<small><sup>2</sup></small><p></blockquote>

	   Even in one of His Own Writings, the Báb, addressing Hájí Siyyid Javád-i-Karbilá'í, complains that the Mirrors have not detached themselves from the things of this world and have turned to Him with sullied hearts. These are His words:<p>

	   mad. But the major part of the book is devoted to the exalted theme of 'Him Whom God shall make manifest', Bahá'u'lláh, the Promised One of the <i>Bayán</i>. Bahá'u'lláh quotes numerous passages from the Writings of the Báb in which He extols the station, the glory, the transcendental majesty and the authority of 'Him Whom God shall make manifest'. It suffices to quote only a few passages from the Writings of the Báb all of which Bahá'u'lláh quotes in the <i>Kitáb-i-Badí'</i>. It should be noted that the Báb's Writings are replete with similar statements about Bahá'u'lláh:<p>
	   <blockquote>I have written down in My mention of Him* these gem-like words: 'No allusion of Mine can allude unto Him, neither anything mentioned in the Bayán.'...Exalted and glorified is He above the power of any one to reveal Him except Himself, or the description of any of His creatures. I Myself am but the first servant to believe in Him and in His signs, and to partake of the sweet savours of His words from the first-fruits of the Paradise of His knowledge. Yea, by His glory! He is the Truth. There is none other God but Him. All have arisen at His bidding.<small><sup>5</sup></small><p></blockquote>
	   The study of the <i>Kitáb-i-Badí'</i> makes it clear that the purpose of the Báb in revealing Himself was none other than to prepare His followers for the coming of Bahá'u'lláh. There are many passages in the Writings of the Báb in which He makes a firm covenant with His followers concerning 'Him Whom God shall make manifest'. In one of these He states:<p>
	   <blockquote>Glorified art Thou, O My God! Bear Thou witness that, through this Book, I have covenanted with all created things concerning the Mission of Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest, ere the covenant concerning Mine own Mission had been established. Sufficient witness art Thou and they that have believed in Thy signs. Thou, verily, sufficest Me.

He also recounts many outstanding events which took place during His sojourn in Baghdád and Adrianople, describes the devotion and self-sacrifice of some of His followers, dwells on the sufferings which were inflicted on Him by the hand of Mírzá Yahyá and which culminated in the 'Most Great Separation', and enumerates some of the grievous transgressions committed by him, such as his orders to kill some of the outstanding Bábís, and his most flagrant crime, the repugnant violation of the honour of the Báb.‡<p>

	   <b>Khadíjih-Bagum</b><p>
	   In the <i>Kitáb-i-Badí</i> Bahá'u'lláh extols the virtues and exalted station of Fátimih-Bagum, the mother of the Báb,* and His wife Khadíjih-Bagum, designates them both as the Khayru'n Nisá' (The Most Virtuous among Women) and enjoins on His loved ones to venerate and honour them.<p>
	   Khadíjih-Bagum was of noble lineage. She was a paternal cousin of the mother of the Báb. Her marriage with the Báb took place almost two years before His declaration. Through the purity of her heart, Khadíjih-Bagum recognized the station of her beloved Husband and acknowledged the truth of His Cause in the early days of His ministry. She was an eye-witness to that transforming power which emanated from the person of the Báb, a power which revolutionized the lives and conduct of His early disciples and the heroes of the Bábí Faith. Concerning Khadíjih-Bagum, Nabíl-i-A'zam writes in his narrative:<p>
	   <blockquote>The wife of the Báb, unlike His mother, perceived at the earliest dawn of His Revelation the glory and uniqueness of His Mission, and felt from the very beginning the intensity of its force. No one except Táhirih, among the women of her generation, surpassed her in the spontaneous character of her devotion nor excelled the fervour of her faith. To her the Báb confided the secret of His future sufferings, and unfolded to her eyes the significance of the events that were to transpire in His Day. He bade her not to divulge this secret to His mother and counselled her to be patient and resigned to the will of God. He entrusted her with a special prayer, revealed and written by Himself, the reading of which, He assured her, would remove her difficulties and lighten the burden of her woes. 'In the hour of your perplexity,' He directed her, 'recite this prayer ere you go to sleep. I Myself will appear to you and will banish your anxiety.' Faithful to His advice, every time she turned to Him in prayer, the</blockquote>

At that time no one among the family of the Afnán§ had embraced the Faith, and therefore the wife of the Báb had no close friend in whom she could confide. For this reason, she entered into conversation about the Faith with the father of the writer, Jináb-i-Afnán, Áqá Mírzá Áqá, &para; who was her nephew (her sister's son), and was then thirteen years of age.<p>
