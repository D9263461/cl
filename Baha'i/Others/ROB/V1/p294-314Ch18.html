	   Never before in history, until the appearance of the Báb, has one Manifestation of God heralded another Who was His contemporary. The Báb was two years younger* than Bahá'u'lláh, and They lived about five hundred miles apart, the Báb in Shíráz and Bahá'u'lláh in Tihrán.<p>
	   The Báb was an independent Manifestation of God Who inaugurated the Bábí Dispensation, abrogated the laws of Islám, formulated new laws and, like other Prophets, founded an independent religion which spread very rapidly throughout Persia and 'Iráq. His advent closed, on the one hand, the Prophetic Cycle in which several Manifestations of God had appeared and given their visions and prophecies concerning the Day of God, and opened, on the other, the Cycle of Fulfilment whose Central Figure is Bahá'u'lláh. He has been acclaimed by Bahá'u'lláh as the 'King of the Messengers', the 'Point round Whom the realities of the Prophets and Messengers revolve', and One Whose 'rank excelleth that of all the Prophets', Whose 'Revelation transcendeth the comprehension and understanding of all their chosen ones'.<small><sup>1</sup></small> His Mission was to prepare men for

These dates are in accordance with the lunar calendar used in the Islámic world. There is a tradition which attributes to Imám 'Alí, the successor of Muhammad, this saying: 'I am two years younger than my Lord'. (The comparable dates in the Christian calendar are, for the Báb, 20 October 1819, and for Bahá'u'lláh, 12 November 1817.)<p>

	   the coming of Bahá'u'lláh, the Supreme Manifestation of God Whose advent has been promised in all the sacred Scriptures of the past.<p>
	   The station of Bahá'u'lláh is so exalted that He was heralded by the Báb, Himself a Manifestation of God, Who paved the way for His coming, established a mighty Covenant concerning His Revelation and reared a new race of men worthy to meet Him and embrace His Cause.<p>
	   The announcement of 'Him Whom God shall make manifest', which the Báb gave to His followers, was firm and irrevocable, more clear and emphatic than that given by any Manifestation of God before Him. In past Dispensations the signs of the coming of the next Manifestation were always wrapped in mystery and expressed in allegorical terms. But the Báb gave no such signs. Rather, He indicated that the glory of 'Him Whom God shall make manifest' would be so strikingly apparent that there would be no need of signs. Yet none could recognize Him through his own knowledge, He warned, nor judge Him by his own standards, nor adduce proofs to establish His authenticity, for He would be exalted above the recognition of His servants and known only through Himself and His Revelation. The sole testimony to His truth would be that which He Himself would reveal, and not that which men might produce. In one of His Writings extolling Bahá'u'lláh, the Báb affirmed that 'Certitude itself is ashamed to be called upon to certify His truth...and Testimony itself is ashamed to testify unto Him'.<small><sup>2</sup></small><p>
	   Throughout His ministry, the Báb continually emphasized the pre-eminence of the Supreme Manifestation Who would follow Him. In one of His prayers communing with Bahá'u'lláh, He revealed these words:<p>
	   <blockquote>Exalted art Thou, O my Lord the Omnipotent! How puny and contemptible my word and all that pertaineth unto me appear unless they be related to Thy great glory. Grant that through the assistance of Thy grace whatsoever pertaineth unto me may be acceptable in Thy sight.<small><sup>3</sup></small><p></blockquote>

	   In another passage He wrote:<p>

	   The Báb's Mission, His teachings, laws and exhortations revolved around 'Him Whom God shall make manifest'. In the Bayán, the Mother Book of His Dispensation, the Báb states that His aim in revealing its each and every letter was to enable His followers to recognize and obey 'Him Whom God shall make manifest'. In another passage of the same Book He included these words:<p>
	   <blockquote>The Bayán is, from beginning to end, the repository of all of His attributes, and the treasury of both His fire and His light.<small><sup>5</sup></small><p></blockquote>
	   The <i>Bayán</i>, He declared, was dependent upon 'Him Whom God shall make manifest', Who, through one word of His mouth, could accept or reject all the laws ordained in it. The Báb mentions that the <i>Bayán</i> derives its glory from 'Him Whom God shall make manifest', Who, in truth, revealed it and Who alone could fully understand the inner meaning of all it contained. In another passage the Báb confirmed that only 'Him Whom God shall make manifest', and those whom He would teach, would be able to understand the significance of all the Holy Books of past Dispensations.<p>
	   The Báb categorically asserted that He was a Messenger sent by 'Him Whom God shall make manifest', a lowly servant at His threshold. He warned His followers that, unless they recognized 'Him Whom God shall make manifest', they would be unfaithful to the <i>Bayán</i> and unworthy in His sight. He explained in the <i>Bayán</i> that those who followed Him and faithfully obeyed the ordinances of God, as revealed in that Book, were the true believers in God. When, however, 'Him Whom God shall make manifest' would come, the spirit of faith would be taken from

	   them unless they recognized Him and embraced His Faith. In another passage He gave the example of one well versed in the <i>Bayán</i>, who had memorized all its verses, had an immense knowledge and was the possessor of every virtue. Should such a man hesitate for one moment to accept the truth of the Cause of 'Him Whom God shall make manifest', his belief in the <i>Bayán</i> would be nullified and his faith in God would become void. Addressing Vahíd, one of the most illustrious among His disciples, the Báb uttered this warning:<p>
	   <blockquote>By the righteousness of Him Whose power causeth the seed to germinate and Who breatheth the spirit of life into all things, were I to be assured that in the day of His manifestation thou wilt deny Him, I would unhesitatingly disown thee and repudiate thy faith...If, on the other hand, I be told that a Christian, who beareth no allegiance to My Faith, will believe in Him, the same will I regard as the apple of Mine Eye.<small><sup>6</sup></small><p></blockquote>
	   In many of His Writings the Báb expressed grief and agony at the thought of those among His followers who might reject the Promised One of the <i>Bayán</i>. Referring to the Revelation of 'Him Whom God shall make manifest', He proclaimed:<p>
	   <blockquote>...If on the day of His Revelation all that are on earth bear Him allegiance, Mine inmost being will rejoice, inasmuch as all will have attained the summit of their existence...If not, My soul will be saddened. I truly have nurtured all things for this purpose. How, then, can any one be veiled from Him? <small><sup>7</sup></small><p></blockquote>
	   Because He was a Manifestation of God, the Báb had true knowledge of the station of Bahá'u'lláh, a knowledge which is beyond the reach of all humanity. His vision of the omnipotence and grandeur of the One who was destined to follow Him was so majestic that no mortal mind can hope to attain it. It is for this reason that the utterances of the Báb in praise of Bahá'u'lláh stagger the imagination of those who are not in some degree aware of His exalted station.

	   portrayed by the Báb, is so glorious and awe-inspiring that He allows no excuse to those who reject it. To the Báb, the advent of Bahá'u'lláh was as clear and evident as the sun and, therefore, He counselled His followers to permit no doubt to enter their minds when informed of the Message of 'Him Whom God shall make manifest'. Should their hearts waver in His Cause, the wrath of God would descend on them so long as such doubts remained.<p>
	   Repeatedly in His Writings, the Báb called on His followers to beware lest anything in this world, including the <i>Bayán</i> and all other Holy Books, should become a barrier between them and 'Him Whom God shall make manifest'. These are some of His words:<p>
	   <blockquote>Suffer not the Bayán and all that hath been revealed therein to withhold you from that Essence of Being and Lord of the visible and invisible.<small><sup>8</sup></small><p></blockquote>
	   And in another passage He revealed:<p>
	   <blockquote>Beware, beware, lest in the days of His Revelation the Vahíd of the Bayán* shut thee out as by a veil from Him, inasmuch as this Vahíd is but a creature in His sight.<small><sup>9</sup></small><p></blockquote>
	   And again He addressed His followers:<p>
	   <blockquote>O congregation of the Bayán, and all who are therein! Recognize ye the limits imposed upon you, for such a One as the Point of the Bayán Himself hath believed in Him Whom God shall make manifest before all things were created. Therein, verily, do I glory before all who are in the kingdom of heaven and earth.<small><sup>10</sup></small><p></blockquote>
	   Many times the Báb alluded to the 'year nine' as the date for the coming of 'Him Whom God shall make manifest'. The Báb's Mission began in the year 1260 A.H. (A.D. 1844). The 'year nine' was 1269 A.H., which opened about the middle of October

	   Here are additional words gleaned from the Arabic <i>Bayán</i> and other Epistles which the Báb wrote to some of His disciples:<p>
	   <blockquote>
	   In the year nine, ye shall attain unto all good.<p>
	   In the year nine, ye will attain unto the presence of God.*<p>
	   After Hín† a Cause shall be given unto you which ye shall come to know.<p>
	   Ere nine will have elapsed from the inception of this Cause, the realities of the created things will not be made manifest. All that thou hast as yet seen is but the stage from the moist germ until We clothed it with flesh. Be patient, until thou beholdest a new creation.

	   On the other hand, the Báb also referred to the year nineteen, a year coinciding with the Declaration of Bahá'u'lláh in Baghdád, which occurred at the end of nineteen lunar years from the inception of the Bahá'í Era. Here is what the Báb wrote:<p>

	   Concerning the date of the coming of 'Him Whom God shall make manifest', the Báb, in the Persian <i>Bayán</i>, called upon His followers to be attentive from the inception of His own Faith until the number of Vahíd, and to hearken to the new Messenger whenever He appeared. Although the Báb frequently referred to the years nine and nineteen, He nevertheless clearly stated that the time of the coming of 'Him Whom God shall make manifest' was entirely in His own hands. Whenever He chose to manifest Himself all must turn to Him and obey His commandments. From the fortress of Máh-Kú the Báb made this weighty pronouncement:<p>
	   <blockquote>Were He to appear this very moment, I would be the first to adore Him, and the first to bow down before Him.<small><sup>13</sup></small><p></blockquote>
	   The Báb lauded in glowing terms the greatness of the Revelation of Bahá'u'lláh. He stated that nothing in the world of creation could give as much pleasure as hearing and understanding the utterances of 'Him Whom God shall make manifest', and remarked that 'A thousand perusals of the <i>Bayán</i> cannot equal the perusal of a single verse to be revealed by "Him Whom God shall make manifest" '.<small><sup>14</sup></small>  In one of the chapters of the <i>Bayán</i> the Báb proclaimed that the most evident testimony to the truth of 'Him Whom God shall make manifest' would be the revelation of His words. That His followers might be aware of the exalted character of the new Revelation, and to prepare them for the coming of 'Him Whom God shall make manifest', the Báb ordained that once in every nineteen days His followers should read this particular chapter and meditate upon it.<p>
	   Referring to those who might arise and announce themselves as the Promised One of the <i>Bayán</i>, the Báb confidently asserted that should anyone falsely claim this station He would be powerless to sustain it, as he would be unable to reveal the Word of God which is the greatest proof of 'Him Whom God shall make manifest'. Nevertheless, for the sake of honouring the station of 'Him Whom God shall make manifest', He ordained that if

	   a person were to claim this station, he should be left to himself; no one should oppose him or object to his words.<p>
	   Anxious to protect Bahá'u'lláh, the Báb forbade His followers to engage in heated argument and controversy, as practised among the divines of Islám, which could only result in contention and discord among them. He urged them to be chaste in their writings and courteous in their speech, especially when expressing their views or adducing proofs during discussion. His purpose in these exhortations was to ensure that the words or deeds of His followers would in no way give offence to the person of 'Him Whom God shall make manifest'. Moreover, as a token of respect for the Supreme Manifestation of God, Who would be exalted above any question His creatures might put to Him, He admonished His followers not to ask Him any questions except those worthy of His station. But Bahá'u'lláh annulled this prohibition in the <i>Kitáb-i-Aqdas</i> and permitted the believers freely to question Him.<p>
	   To read the Writings of the Báb, especially the <i>Bayán</i>, is to realize that He prepared His followers in every possible way for the coming of 'Him Whom God shall make manifest'. Not only did He give them a true understanding of His station and reveal the spiritual prerequisites of worthiness to receive His Revelation, but He also instructed them on their behaviour. They should, He advised them, not only purify their inner beings from attachment to this world, but, in addition, should pay attention to their appearance and clothing so as not to offend Him.<p>
	   In several passages in the <i>Bayán</i> and other Writings, the Báb mentioned Bahá'u'lláh by name and alluded to Him as 'Him Whom God shall make manifest'. All these references clearly indicate Bahá'u'lláh as the Promised One of the <i>Bayán</i> and the object of the adoration of the Báb. A striking example is to be found in the Persian <i>Bayán</i> where, in the course of a reference to 'Him Whom God shall make manifest', the Báb anticipated the establishment of a new Order by Bahá'u'lláh. These are His words:<p>

	   Many were the tributes which the Báb paid in His Writings to the inconceivable greatness of the Revelation of 'Him Whom God shall make manifest' and numerous were the expressions of His loyalty and self-effacement towards its Author. Having recognized Him to be the Source of His inspiration, the Revealer of His Revelation, and the Object of His adoration, the Báb often craved to lay down His life as a sacrifice in the path of 'Him Whom God shall make manifest'. In the <i>Qayyúmu'l-Asmá'</i>,* described by Bahá'u'lláh as the 'first, the greatest and mightiest' <small><sup>16</sup></small> of the books revealed by the Báb, we find the following references to Bahá'u'lláh--'Him Whom God shall make manifest':<p>
	   <blockquote>
	   Out of utter nothingness, O great and omnipotent Master, Thou hast, through the celestial potency of Thy might, brought me forth and raised me up to proclaim this Revelation. I have made none other but Thee my trust; I have clung to no will but Thy will...O Thou Remnant of God! I have sacrificed myself wholly for Thee; I have accepted curses for Thy sake, and have yearned for naught but martyrdom in the path of Thy love. Sufficient witness unto me is God, the Exalted, the Protector, the Ancient of Days...<p>
	   And when the appointed hour hath struck, do Thou, by the leave of God, the All-Wise, reveal from the heights of the Most Lofty and Mystic Mount a faint, an infinitesimal glimmer of Thy impenetrable Mystery, that they who have recognized the radiance of the Sinaic Splendour may faint away and die as they catch a lightening glimpse of the fierce and crimson Light that envelops Thy Revelation.<small><sup>17</sup></small><p>

	   incomparable and infinitely glorious. Their study enables one to acquire a better grasp of the <span TITLE="a statement, principle, or belief, that is true, especially an enduring truth.">verities</span> of the Faith of Bahá'u'lláh, although bringing to light man's inadequacy fully to appreciate the significance of His Revelation, comprehend the potency of His words, or recognize the loftiness of His station.<p>
	   It was perhaps owing to this inadequacy that, at one stage during the ministry of Bahá'u'lláh, there were two major schools of thought among the believers concerning His station. Some believed Him to be the Supreme Manifestation of God, while others went further than this. When Bahá'u'lláh was asked about His station, He confirmed that as long as individuals were sincere in their beliefs, both views were right, but if they argued among themselves or tried to convert each other, both were wrong. This indicates that man because of his finite mind will never be able to understand the true station of the Manifestation of God. The criteria are sincerity and faith. Knowing man's limitations, God accepts from him what he is able to achieve.<p>
	   Despite this divergence of view among the early followers of Bahá'u'lláh as to His station, attributable solely to their varying capacities to grasp so exalted a concept, it is of immense significance that the central purpose of His Revelation to bring unity to mankind was never deflected. From its earliest days the Bahá'í community was protected from division and discord, and has continued throughout its eventful history to demonstrate the cohesive and unifying influence which motivates it. Those who recognize Bahá'u'lláh and embrace His Faith come under the shelter of a unity which is spiritual in nature, which surpasses all human limitations, and is derived from the power of God's Covenant for humanity in this age.<p>
	   In the Writings of the Central Figures of the Bahá'í Faith there are many references to the exalted nature of the Revelation of Bahá'u'lláh. Shoghi Effendi, the Guardian of the Faith, also elucidated this theme. Indeed, it may be said that one of his

	   major contributions to the consolidation of the Faith was his clear explanation concerning the significance of the Revelation of Bahá'u'lláh. In his momentous work, The Dispensation of Bahá'u'lláh, he placed in right perspective every aspect of the Revelation: its Founders, its institutions, its guiding principles, its aims and purposes and its ultimate destiny. Prior to his elucidation and guidance, no coherent pattern was available to Bahá'ís for the proper and systematic study of their Faith. It was Shoghi Effendi who adapted the stupendous Revelation of Bahá'u'lláh to the limited capacity of man in this age, helped to canalize the outpourings of its spiritual energy, and enabled the believers to bring into focus their vision of the Faith, and to understand its workings.<p>
	   The following is an extract from one of Shoghi Effendi's masterly expositions concerning the Revelation of Bahá'u'lláh and His station:<p>
	   <blockquote>
	   He* Who in such dramatic circumstances was made to sustain the overpowering weight of so glorious a Mission was none other than the One Whom posterity will acclaim, and Whom innumerable followers already recognize, as the Judge, the Lawgiver and Redeemer of all mankind, as the Organizer of the entire planet, as the Unifier of the children of men, as the Inaugurator of the long-awaited millennium, as the Originator of a new 'Universal Cycle,' as the Establisher of the Most Great Peace, as the Fountain of the Most Great Justice, as the Proclaimer of the coming of age of the entire human race, as the Creator of a new World Order, and as the Inspirer and Founder of a world civilization.<p>
	   To Israel He was neither more nor less than the incarnation of the 'Everlasting Father,' the 'Lord of Hosts' come down 'with ten thousands of saints'; to Christendom Christ returned 'in the glory of the Father,' to Shí'ah Islám the return of the Imám Husayn; to Sunní Islám the descent of the 'Spirit of God' (Jesus Christ); to the Zoroastrians the promised Sháh-Bahrám; to the Hindus the reincarnation of Krishna; to the Buddhists the fifth Buddha.<p>

He derived His descent, on the one hand, from Abraham (the Father of the Faithful) through his wife Katurah, and on the other from Zoroaster, as well as from Yazdigird, the last king of the Sásáníyán dynasty. He was moreover a descendant of Jesse, and belonged, through His father, Mírzá 'Abbás, better known as Mírzá Buzurg--a nobleman closely associated with the ministerial circles of the Court of Fath-'Alí Sháh--to one of the most ancient and renowned families of Mázindarán.<p>

	   Bahá'í Writings contain several references to Bahá'u'lláh as the universal Manifestation of God, Who inaugurated a new and universal cycle in human history. 'Abdu'l-Bahá has explained this in answer to a question:<p>
	   <blockquote>Briefly, we say a universal cycle in the world of existence signifies a long duration of time, and innumerable and incalculable periods and epochs. In such a cycle the Manifestations appear with splendour in the realm of the visible, until a great and universal Manifestation makes the world the centre of His radiance. His appearance causes the world to attain to maturity, and the extension of His cycle is very great. Afterwards other Manifestations will arise under His shadow, who according to the needs of the time will renew certain commandments relating to material questions and affairs, while remaining under His shadow.<small><sup>19</sup></small><p></blockquote>
	   Not only is Bahá'u'lláh the Author of the Bahá'í Dispensation whose duration, according to His own testimony, will be at least one thousand years, but He is also the Inaugurator of a universal cycle which is referred to as the Bahá'í Cycle. 'Abdu'l-Bahá mentions that the duration of this cycle will be at least five thousand centuries. During this period several Manifestations of God will appear, Who, while founding independent religions, will yet derive their inspiration from Bahá'u'lláh. In a Tablet 'Abdu'l-Bahá has made the following statement:<p>
	   <blockquote>Concerning the Manifestations that will come down in the future 'in the shadows of the clouds', know verily that in so far as their relation to the source of their inspiration is concerned they are under the shadow of the Ancient Beauty.* In their relation, however, to the age in which they appear, each and every one of them 'doeth whatsoever He willeth'.<small><sup>20</sup></small><p></blockquote>
	   In the light of the above statements it becomes clear that Bahá'u'lláh, through His own Revelation, is the source of spiritual life for mankind during the Bahá'í Dispensation. He will also remain the motivating force in future Dispensations

	   and will release progressively, through the advent of other Manifestations of God, spiritual energies for the advancement of the human race throughout the Bahá'í Cycle. It is a central tenet of Bahá'í belief that the reality of the Manifestations of God is one and the same and that They differ only in the intensity of Their Revelations, each One manifesting the attributes of God in accordance with the capacity and receptivity of the people of His age. At first sight, this belief may not seem to accord with the statement that future Manifestations will be under the shadow of Bahá'u'lláh, while yet bringing new laws and teachings for mankind, each One inaugurating a new era within the Bahá'í Cycle. But let us look more closely.<p>
	   The coming of a Manifestation of God may be likened to the appearance of spring in the physical realm. In the same way that the world of nature receives new life at each springtime, so humanity becomes refreshed and revivified by the advent of each Manifestation of God. We observe in nature that, as a result of the succession of seasons year after year, a tree grows progressively until it reaches a stage when it bears fruit for the first time. This is an event of great consequence, for the tree has reached its maturity and will throughout its life continue to produce similar fruits each year.<p>
	   Similarly, man has grown progressively and step by step as a result of the appearance of the Manifestations of God. The Revelation of Bahá'u'lláh occurs in an era when mankind is destined to come of age, a stage similar to that when the tree blossoms and first gives its fruit. Therefore, whatever mankind may achieve as a result of the outpouring of the Revelation of Bahá'u'lláh, whatever fruit the tree of humanity may yield during the Golden Age of His Dispensation, will provide the foundation for progress in future Dispensations. The study of the Writings will demonstrate that the ultimate objective of Bahá'u'lláh, so far as life on this planet is concerned, is the establishment of the oneness of mankind. This will be the fruit of His Revelation in relation to the structure of human society, the furthermost goal humanity can attain on this earth.<p>

	   In Dispensations to come, man, as a result of the appearance of future Manifestations of God, will continue to develop and progress. He will acquire noble qualities and will grow spiritually to such a degree that none today can visualize the heights to which he will attain; yet he will function within the framework of the oneness of mankind established by Bahá'u'lláh, and the Manifestations of God Who appear from age to age during the Bahá'í Cycle will remain under His shadow.<p>
	   Bahá'u'lláh, addressing His own generation, has affirmed the nature of the enduring foundation He has laid for mankind:<p>
	   <blockquote>O ye children of men, the fundamental purpose animating the Faith of God and His Religion is to safeguard the interests and promote the unity of the human race...This is the straight path, the fixed and immovable foundation. Whatsoever is raised on this foundation, the changes and chances of the world can never impair its strength, nor will the revolution of countless centuries undermine its structure.<small><sup>21</sup></small><p></blockquote>
	   The following illuminating passage, composed by Shoghi Effendi concerning the Revelation of Bahá'u'lláh and its significance, in which he has quoted utterances of Bahá'u'lláh, emphasizes the pre-eminent character of this august Revelation:<p>
	   <blockquote>
	   The Faith of Bahá'u'lláh should indeed be regarded, if we wish to be faithful to the tremendous implications of its message, as the culmination of a cycle, the final stage in a series of successive, of preliminary and progressive revelations. These, beginning with Adam and ending with the Báb, have paved the way and anticipated with an ever-increasing emphasis the advent of that Day of Days in which He Who is the Promise of All Ages should be made manifest.<p>
	   To this truth the utterances of Bahá'u'lláh abundantly testify. A mere reference to the claims which, in vehement language and with compelling power, He Himself has repeatedly advanced cannot but fully demonstrate the character of the Revelation of which He was the chosen bearer. To the words that have streamed from His pen--the fountainhead of so impetuous a Revelation--we should, therefore, direct
