	1.	His genealogy, according to his son Shaykh ‘Abdu’lláh, is the following: “Shaykh Ahmad-ibn-i-Zaynu’d-Dín-ibn-i-Ibráhím-ibn-i-Sakhr-ibn-i-Ibráhím-ibn-i-Záhir-ibn-i-Ramadan-ibn-i-Rashíd-ibn-i-Dahím-ibn-i-Shimrukh-ibn-i-Súlih.” (A. L. M. Nicolas’ “Essai sur le Shaykhisme” I, p. 1.)   [ Back To Reference]<p>
	2.	Born Rajab, 1166 A.H., 24th of April-24th of May, 1753, in town of Ahsá in district of Ahsá, northeast of Arabian peninsula. (A. L. M. Nicolas’ “Essai sur le Shaykhisme,” I, p. 1.) Born a shí’ah, though his ancestors were sunnís. (Ibid., p. 2.) According to E. G. Browne (“A Traveller’s Narrative,” Note E, p. 235), Shaykh Ahmad was born in the year 1157 A.H. and died in 1242.

	3.	Siyyid Kázim, in his book entitled “Dalílu’l-Mutaháyyirín,” writes as follows: “Our master, one night, saw the Imám Hasan; upon him may the blessing of God rest! His Holiness put in his mouth his blessed tongue. From the adorable saliva of His Holiness he drew forth the sciences and the assistance of God. To the taste it was sweeter even than honey, more perfumed than the musk. It was also quite warm. When he came to himself and wakened from his dream, he inwardly radiated the light of divine contemplation; his soul overflowed with the blessings of God and became entirely severed from everything save God.<p>
	“His faith, his trust in God and his resignation to the Will of the Most High grew apace. Because of a great love and an ardent desire which arose in his heart, he forgot to eat or to clothe himself except barely enough to sustain life.” (A. L. M. Nicolas’ “Essai sur le Shaykhisme,” I, p. 6.)   [ Back To Reference]<p>
	4.	“He [Shaykh Ahmad] knew full well that he was chosen of God to prepare men’s hearts for the reception of the more complete truth shortly to be revealed, and that through him the way of access to the hidden twelfth Imám Mihdí was reopened. But he did not set this forth in clear and unmistakable terms, lest ‘the unregenerate’ should turn again and rend him.” (Dr. T. K. Cheyne’s “The Reconciliation of Races and Religions,” p. 15.)
