    AT A time when the shining reality of the Faith of Muhammad had been obscured by the ignorance, the fanaticism, and perversity of the contending sects into which it had fallen, there appeared above the horizon of the East 1 that luminous Star of Divine guidance, Shaykh Ahmad-i-Ahsá’í. 2 He observed how those who professed the Faith of Islám had shattered its unity, sapped its force, perverted its purpose, and degraded its holy name. His soul was filled with anguish at the sight of the corruption and strife which characterised the Shí’ah sect of Islám. Inspired by the light that shone within him, 3 he arose with unerring vision, with fixed purpose, and sublime detachment to utter his protest against the betrayal of the Faith by that ignoble people. Aglow with zeal and conscious of the sublimity of his calling, he vehemently appealed not only to shí’ah Islám but to all the followers of Muhammad throughout 2 the East, to awaken from the slumber of negligence and to prepare the way for Him who must needs be made manifest in the fulness of time, whose light alone could dissipate the mists of prejudice and ignorance which had enveloped that Faith. Forsaking his home and kindred, on one of the islands of Bahrayn, to the south of the Persian Gulf, he set out, as bidden by an almighty Providence, to unravel the mysteries of those verses of Islamic Scriptures which foreshadowed the advent of a new Manifestation. He was well aware of the dangers and perils that beset his path; he fully realised the crushing responsibility of his task. There burned in his soul the conviction that no reform, however drastic, within the Faith of Islám, could achieve the regeneration of this perverse people. He knew, and was destined by the Will of God to demonstrate, that nothing short of a new and independent Revelation, as attested and foreshadowed by the sacred Scriptures of Islám, could revive the fortunes and restore the purity of that decadent Faith. 4

	1.	His genealogy, according to his son Shaykh ‘Abdu’lláh, is the following: “Shaykh Ahmad-ibn-i-Zaynu’d-Dín-ibn-i-Ibráhím-ibn-i-Sakhr-ibn-i-Ibráhím-ibn-i-Záhir-ibn-i-Ramadan-ibn-i-Rashíd-ibn-i-Dahím-ibn-i-Shimrukh-ibn-i-Súlih.” (A. L. M. Nicolas’ “Essai sur le Shaykhisme” I, p. 1.)   [ Back To Reference]<p>
	2.	Born Rajab, 1166 A.H., 24th of April-24th of May, 1753, in town of Ahsá in district of Ahsá, northeast of Arabian peninsula. (A. L. M. Nicolas’ “Essai sur le Shaykhisme,” I, p. 1.) Born a shí’ah, though his ancestors were sunnís. (Ibid., p. 2.) According to E. G. Browne (“A Traveller’s Narrative,” Note E, p. 235), Shaykh Ahmad was born in the year 1157 A.H. and died in 1242.

	3.	Siyyid Kázim, in his book entitled “Dalílu’l-Mutaháyyirín,” writes as follows: “Our master, one night, saw the Imám Hasan; upon him may the blessing of God rest! His Holiness put in his mouth his blessed tongue. From the adorable saliva of His Holiness he drew forth the sciences and the assistance of God. To the taste it was sweeter even than honey, more perfumed than the musk. It was also quite warm. When he came to himself and wakened from his dream, he inwardly radiated the light of divine contemplation; his soul overflowed with the blessings of God and became entirely severed from everything save God.<p>
	“His faith, his trust in God and his resignation to the Will of the Most High grew apace. Because of a great love and an ardent desire which arose in his heart, he forgot to eat or to clothe himself except barely enough to sustain life.” (A. L. M. Nicolas’ “Essai sur le Shaykhisme,” I, p. 6.)   [ Back To Reference]<p>
	4.	“He [Shaykh Ahmad] knew full well that he was chosen of God to prepare men’s hearts for the reception of the more complete truth shortly to be revealed, and that through him the way of access to the hidden twelfth Imám Mihdí was reopened. But he did not set this forth in clear and unmistakable terms, lest ‘the unregenerate’ should turn again and rend him.” (Dr. T. K. Cheyne’s “The Reconciliation of Races and Religions,” p. 15.)
