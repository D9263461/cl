In the Bahá'í Writings these terms are used in a spiritual rather than a literal, material sense. These conditions of 'heaven' and 'hell' are not limited to life after death. 'Heaven' is the state of perfection and nearness to God, achieved by a soul who has striven to acquire virtues during its life on earth, while 'hell' is the condition of imperfection, remoteness and the awareness of the deprivation one has brought by one's actions. Bahá'u'lláh explains in the Kitáb-i-Íqán that the use of the word 'heaven' in earlier prophecies such as the 'cleaving asunder of the heaven' is metaphorical not literal" href="../../../CLUG/UnifiedGlossary.html#HeavenandHell">heaven</a> and all who are on earth. Potent art Thou to do as pleaseth Thee. In Thy hands is the <a class="hh" title="God is exalted above attributes, however, in all His worlds, spiritual and physical, He reveals the kingdom of His attributes. In this world every one of God's attributes is clad with a name, and every such name reveals the characteristics of its attribute. Usually, man ascribes these attributes to his own person rather than to God and employs them to exalt his own ego. In many of His Tablets Bahá'u'lláh exhorts His followers not to become the bond-slaves of the Kingdom of Names...Human society at present exerts a pernicious influence upon the soul of man...it teaches him to pride himself on his accomplishments...The Revelation of Bahá'u'lláh aims to reverse this process...If a man can only realize that his virtues are not intrinsically his own, but rather are manifestations of the attributes of God, then he is freed from the Kingdom of Names and becomes truly humble. This is the loftiest station that God has destined for man." href="../../../CLUG/UnifiedGlossary.html#KingdomofNames">empire of all names</a>. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Wise.</td>

In the Bahá'í Writings these terms are used in a spiritual rather than a literal, material sense. These conditions of 'heaven' and 'hell' are not limited to life after death. 'Heaven' is the state of perfection and nearness to God, achieved by a soul who has striven to acquire virtues during its life on earth, while 'hell' is the condition of imperfection, remoteness and the awareness of the deprivation one has brought by one's actions. Bahá'u'lláh explains in the Kitáb-i-Íqán that the use of the word 'heaven' in earlier prophecies such as the 'cleaving asunder of the heaven' is metaphorical not literal" href="../../../CLUG/UnifiedGlossary.html#HeavenandHell">heaven</a>s and earth or with the entire realm of creation. Have mercy on me, O Lord, in these days when the peoples of Thine earth have erred grievously; supply me then, O my God, with that which is good and seemly in Thine estimation. Thou art, verily, the All-Powerful, the Gracious, the Bountiful, the Ever-Forgiving.</td>
