One possible explanation: Thirst is a common religous metaphor for a soul's deep longing for a divine connection, while quenching that thirst refers to finding satisfaction through faith in God. The metaphor addresses a fundamental reality of the human condition: a spiritual void that worldly things can never fully satisfy. Many religious traditions describe this unfulfilled longing as a ''God-shaped hole'' in the human heart that can only be filled by God. Attempting to fill this void with material possessions, success, relationships, or pleasure is often compared to drinking saltwater--it only intensifies the thirst. God is the universal source of ''living water''. God's provision for spiritual fulfillment is offered to everyone. ''If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink'' (John 7:37) is a universal invitation to all men, regardless of their background or past.

One possible explanation: Thirst is a common religous metaphor for a soul's deep longing for a divine connection, while quenching that thirst refers to finding satisfaction through faith in God. The metaphor addresses a fundamental reality of the human condition: a spiritual void that worldly things can never fully satisfy. Many religious traditions describe this unfulfilled longing as a ''God-shaped hole'' in the human heart that can only be filled by God. Attempting to fill this void with material possessions, success, relationships, or pleasure is often compared to drinking saltwater--it only intensifies the thirst. God is the universal source of ''living water''. God's provision for spiritual fulfillment is offered to everyone. ''If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink'' (John 7:37) is a universal invitation to all men, regardless of their background or past.

	Attire her, by Thy sovereignty and Thy loving-kindness, O my God and my Beloved, with the raiment of Thy balm and Thy healing, and make her <a class="hh" title="Drink heartily. One possible explanation: Thirst is a common religous metaphor for a soul's deep longing for a divine connection, while quenching that thirst refers to finding satisfaction through faith in God. The metaphor addresses a fundamental reality of the human condition: a spiritual void that worldly things can never fully satisfy. Many religious traditions describe this unfulfilled longing as a ''God-shaped hole'' in the human heart that can only be filled by God. Attempting to fill this void with material possessions, success, relationships, or pleasure is often compared to drinking saltwater--it only intensifies the thirst. God is the universal source of ''living water''. God's provision for spiritual fulfillment is offered to everyone. ''If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink'' (John 7:37) is a universal invitation to all men, regardless of their background or past.

Have mercy, then, upon Thy servants by Thy grace and bounty, and suffer them not to be kept back from the shores of the ocean of Thy nearness.

It is undisputed, however, that the influence of Thine attraction hath everlastingly been inherent in the realities of Thy handiwork, although that which beseemeth the hallowed court of Thy providence is exalted beyond the attainment of the entire creation.

One possible explanation: Thirst is a common religous metaphor for a soul's deep longing for a divine connection, while quenching that thirst refers to finding satisfaction through faith in God.

Many religious traditions describe this unfulfilled longing as a ''God-shaped hole'' in the human heart that can only be filled by God. Attempting to fill this void with material possessions, success, relationships, or pleasure is often compared to drinking saltwater--it only intensifies the thirst. God is the universal source of ''living water''. God's provision for spiritual fulfillment is offered to everyone. ''If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink'' (John 7:37) is a universal invitation to all men, regardless of their background or past.

One possible explanation: Thirst is a common religous metaphor for a soul's deep longing for a divine connection, while quenching that thirst refers to finding satisfaction through faith in God. The metaphor addresses a fundamental reality of the human condition: a spiritual void that worldly things can never fully satisfy. Many religious traditions describe this unfulfilled longing as a ''God-shaped hole'' in the human heart that can only be filled by God. Attempting to fill this void with material possessions, success, relationships, or pleasure is often compared to drinking saltwater--it only intensifies the thirst. God is the universal source of ''living water''. God's provision for spiritual fulfillment is offered to everyone. ''If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink'' (John 7:37) is a universal invitation to all men, regardless of their background or past.

One possible explanation: Thirst is a common religous metaphor for a soul's deep longing for a divine connection, while quenching that thirst refers to finding satisfaction through faith in God. The metaphor addresses a fundamental reality of the human condition: a spiritual void that worldly things can never fully satisfy. Many religious traditions describe this unfulfilled longing as a ''God-shaped hole'' in the human heart that can only be filled by God. Attempting to fill this void with material possessions, success, relationships, or pleasure is often compared to drinking saltwater--it only intensifies the thirst. God is the universal source of ''living water''. God's provision for spiritual fulfillment is offered to everyone. ''If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink'' (John 7:37) is a universal invitation to all men, regardless of their background or past.

One possible explanation: Thirst is a common religous metaphor for a soul's deep longing for a divine connection, while quenching that thirst refers to finding satisfaction through faith in God. The metaphor addresses a fundamental reality of the human condition: a spiritual void that worldly things can never fully satisfy. Many religious traditions describe this unfulfilled longing as a ''God-shaped hole'' in the human heart that can only be filled by God. Attempting to fill this void with material possessions, success, relationships, or pleasure is often compared to drinking saltwater--it only intensifies the thirst. God is the universal source of ''living water''. God's provision for spiritual fulfillment is offered to everyone. ''If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink'' (John 7:37) is a universal invitation to all men, regardless of their background or past.

One possible explanation: Thirst is a common religous metaphor for a soul's deep longing for a divine connection, while quenching that thirst refers to finding satisfaction through faith in God. The metaphor addresses a fundamental reality of the human condition: a spiritual void that worldly things can never fully satisfy. Many religious traditions describe this unfulfilled longing as a ''God-shaped hole'' in the human heart that can only be filled by God. Attempting to fill this void with material possessions, success, relationships, or pleasure is often compared to drinking saltwater--it only intensifies the thirst. God is the universal source of ''living water''. God's provision for spiritual fulfillment is offered to everyone. ''If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink'' (John 7:37) is a universal invitation to all men, regardless of their background or past.

''As to the reference...that the human being must become detached from self...the meaning is that he should not seek out anything whatever for his own self in this swiftly passing life, but that he should cut the self away, that is, he should yield up the self and all its concerns...''
