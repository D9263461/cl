	  <b><a name="note1"/>1. the sweet-smelling savour of My garment <a href="p019-088Aqdas.html#para4">&para;4</a></b><p>
	  This is an allusion to the story of Joseph in the Qur'án and the Old Testament, in which Joseph's garment, brought by his brothers to Jacob, their father, enabled Jacob to identify his beloved long-lost son. The metaphor of the fragrant <i>"garment"</i> is frequently used in the Bahá'i Writings to refer to the recognition of the Manifestation of God and His Revelation.<p>
	  Bahá'u'lláh, in one of His Tablets, describes Himself as the <i>"Divine Joseph"</i> Who has been <i>"bartered away"</i> by the heedless <i>"for the most paltry of prices"</i>. The Báb, in the Qayyúmu'l-Asmá', identifies Bahá'u'lláh as the <i>"true Joseph"</i> and forecasts the ordeals that He would endure at the hands of His treacherous brother (see note <a href="#note190">190</a>). Likewise, Shoghi Effendi draws a parallel between the intense jealousy which the preeminence of 'Abdu'l-Bahá had aroused in His half-brother, Mírzá Muhammad-'Alí, and the deadly envy "which the superior excellence of Joseph had kindled in the hearts of his brothers".<p>

	  The consumption of wine and other intoxicants is prohibited in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas (see notes <a href="#note144">144</a> and <a href="#note170">170</a>).<p>
	  Reference to the use of "wine" in an allegorical sense--such as being the cause of spiritual ecstasy--is found, not only in the Revelation of Bahá'u'lláh, but in the Bible, in the Qur'án, and in ancient Hindu traditions.<p>
	  <a name="p166"/>For example, in the Qur'án the righteous are promised that they will be given to drink of the <i>"choice sealed wine"</i>. In His Tablets, Bahá'u'lláh identifies the <i>"choice Wine"</i> with His Revelation whose <i>"musk-laden fragrance"</i> has been wafted <i>"upon all created things"</i>. He states that He has <i>"unsealed"</i> this <i>"Wine"</i>, thereby disclosing spiritual truths that were hitherto unknown, and enabling those who quaff thereof to <i>"discern the splendours of the light of divine unity"</i> and to <i>"grasp the essential purpose underlying the Scriptures of God"</i>.<p>
	  In one of His meditations, Bahá'u'lláh entreats God to supply the believers with <i>"the choice Wine of Thy mercy, that it may cause them to be forgetful of any one except Thee, and to arise to serve Thy Cause, and to be steadfast in their love for Thee"</i>.<p>

	  <b><a name="note3"/>3. We have enjoined obligatory prayer upon you <a href="p019-088Aqdas.html#para6">&para;6</a></b><p>
	  In Arabic, there are several words for prayer. The word "salát", which appears here in the original, refers to a particular category of prayers, the recitation of which at specific times of the day is enjoined on the believers. To differentiate this category of prayers from other kinds, the word has been translated as <i>"obligatory prayer"</i>.<p>
	  Bahá'u'lláh states that <i>"obligatory prayer and fasting occupy an exalted station in the sight of God"</i> (<a href="p103-140QA.html#qa93">Q&A 93</a>). 'Abdu'l-Bahá affirms that such prayers are <i>"conducive to humility and submissiveness, to setting one's face towards God and expressing devotion to Him"</i>, and that through these prayers <i>"man holdeth communion with God, seeketh to draw near unto Him, converseth with the true Beloved of his heart, and attaineth spiritual stations"</i>.<p>
	  The Obligatory Prayer (see <a href="#note9">note 9</a>) referred to in this verse has been superseded by the three Obligatory Prayers later revealed by Bahá'u'lláh (<a href="p103-140QA.html#qa63">Q&A 63</a>). The texts of the three prayers currently in use, together with instructions regarding their recital, are to be found in this volume in <a href="p089-102Supp.html">Some Texts Supplementary to the Kitáb-i-Aqdas</a>.<p>
	  A number of the items in Questions and Answers deal <a name="p167"/> with aspects of the three new Obligatory Prayers. Bahá'u'lláh clarifies that the individual is permitted to choose any one of the three Obligatory Prayers (<a href="p103-140QA.html#qa65">Q&A 65</a>). Other provisions are elucidated in Questions and Answers, numbers <a href="p103-140QA.html#qa66">66</a>, <a href="p103-140QA.html#qa67">67</a>, <a href="p103-140QA.html#qa81">81</a>, and <a href="p103-140QA.html#qa82">82</a>.<p>

	  A rak'ah is the recitation of specifically revealed verses accompanied by a prescribed set of <span title="To bend the knee or touch the knee to the floor or ground, as in worship.">genuflections</span> and other movements.<p>
	  The Obligatory Prayer originally enjoined by Bahá'u'lláh upon His followers consisted of nine rak'ahs. The precise nature of this prayer and the specific instructions for its recitation are unknown, as the prayer has been lost. (See <a href="#note9">note 9</a>.)<p>
	  In a Tablet commenting on the presently-binding Obligatory Prayers, 'Abdu'l-Bahá indicates that <i>"in every word and movement of the Obligatory Prayer there are allusions, mysteries and a wisdom that man is unable to comprehend, and letters and scrolls cannot contain"</i>.<p>
	  Shoghi Effendi explains that the few simple directions given by Bahá'u'lláh for the recital of certain prayers not only have a spiritual significance but that they also help the individual "to fully concentrate when praying and meditating".<p>

	  Regarding the definition of the words <i>"morning"</i>, <i>"noon"</i> and <i>"evening"</i>, at which times the currently binding medium Obligatory Prayer is to be recited, Bahá'u'lláh has stated that these coincide with <i>"sunrise, noon and sunset"</i> (<a href="p103-140QA.html#qa83">Q&A 83</a>). He specifies that the <i>"allowable times for Obligatory Prayers are from morning till noon, from noon till sunset, and from sunset till <a name="p168"/> two hours thereafter"</i>. Further, 'Abdu'l-Bahá has stated that the morning Obligatory Prayer may be said as early as dawn.<p>
	  The definition of <i>"noon"</i> as the period <i>"from noon till sunset"</i> applies to the recitation of the short Obligatory Prayer as well as the medium one.<p>

	  The requirements for obligatory prayer called for in the Bábí and Islámic Dispensations were more demanding than those for the performance of the Obligatory Prayer consisting of nine rak'ahs that was prescribed in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas (see <a href="#note4">note 4</a>).<p>
	  In the Bayán, the Báb prescribed an Obligatory Prayer consisting of nineteen rak'ahs which was to be performed once in a twenty-four-hour period--from noon of one day to noon of the next.<p>
	  The Muslim prayer is recited five times a day, namely, in the early morning, at midday, in the afternoon and evening, and at night. While the number of rak'ahs varies according to the time of recitation, a total of seventeen rak'ahs are offered in the course of a day.<p>

	  The <i>"Point of Adoration"</i>, that is, the point to which the worshipper should turn when offering obligatory prayer, is called the Qiblih. The concept of Qiblih has existed in previous religions. Jerusalem in the past had been fixed for this purpose. Muhammad changed the Qiblih to Mecca. The Báb's instructions in the Arabic Bayán were:<p>
	  <blockquote><i>The Qiblih is indeed He Whom God will make manifest; whenever He moveth, it moveth, until He shall come to rest.</i></blockquote>
	  This passage is quoted by Bahá'u'lláh in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas <a name="p169"/>(<a href="p019-088Aqdas.html#para137">&para;137</a>) and confirmed by Him in the above-noted verse. He has also indicated that facing in the direction of the Qiblih is a <i>"fixed requirement for the recitation of obligatory prayer"</i> (Q&A <a href="p103-140QA.html#qa14">14</a> and <a href="p103-140QA.html#qa67">67</a>).

	  Bahá'u'lláh ordains His resting-place as the Qiblih after His passing. The Most Holy Tomb is at Bahjí, 'Akká. 'Abdu'l-Bahá describes that Spot as the <i>"luminous Shrine"</i>, <i>"the place around which circumambulate the Concourse on High"</i>.<p>
	  In a letter written on his behalf, Shoghi Effendi uses the analogy of the plant turning in the direction of the sun to explain the spiritual significance of turning towards the Qiblih:<p>
	  <blockquote>. . .just as the plant stretches out to the sunlight--from which it receives life and growth--so we turn our hearts to the Manifestation of God, Bahá'u'lláh, when we pray; . . . we turn our faces . . . to where His dust lies on this earth as a symbol of the inner act.</blockquote>

	  The exemption of those who are weak due to illness or advanced age from offering the Obligatory Prayers and from fasting is explained in Questions and Answers. Bahá'u'lláh indicates that in <i>"time of ill-health it is not permissible to observe these obligations"</i> (<a href="p103-140QA.html#qa93">Q&A 93</a>). He defines old age, in this context, as being from seventy (<a href="p103-140QA.html#qa74">Q&A 74</a>). In answer to a question, Shoghi Effendi has clarified that people who attain the age of seventy are exempt, whether or not they are weak.<p>

	  Congregational prayer, in the sense of formal obligatory prayer which is to be recited in accordance with a prescribed ritual as, for example, is the custom in Islám where Friday prayer in the mosque is led by an imám, has been annulled in the Bahá'i Dispensation. The Prayer for the Dead (see <a href="p165-251Notes.html#note10">note 10</a>) is the only congregational prayer prescribed by Bahá'i law. It is to be recited by one of those present while the remainder of the party stands in silence; the reader has <a name="p173"/> no special status.

	  There is no prescribed way for the recital of the many other Bahá'i prayers, and all are free to use such non-obligatory prayers in gatherings or individually as they please. In this regard, Shoghi Effendi states that

	  Exemption from obligatory prayer and fasting is granted to women who are menstruating; they should, instead, perform their ablutions (see <a href="p165-251Notes.html#note34">note 34</a> ) and repeat 95 times a day between one noon and the next, the verse <i>"Glorified be God, the Lord of Splendour and Beauty"</i>. This provision has its antecedent in the Arabic Bayán, where a similar dispensation was granted.<p>
	  In some earlier religious Dispensations, women in their courses were considered ritually unclean and were forbidden to observe the duties of prayer and fasting. The concept of ritual uncleanness has been abolished by Bahá'u'lláh (see <a href="p165-251Notes.html#note106">note 106</a>).<p>
	  The Universal House of Justice has clarified that the provisions in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas granting exemptions from certain duties and responsibilities are, as the word indicates, exemptions and not prohibitions. Any believer is, therefore, free to avail himself or herself of an applicable exemption if he or she so wishes. However, the House of Justice counsels <a name="p174"/> that, in deciding whether to do so or not, the believer should use wisdom and realize that Bahá'u'lláh has granted these exemptions for good reason.<p>
	  The prescribed exemption from obligatory prayer, originally related to the Obligatory Prayer consisting of nine rak'ahs, is now applicable to the three Obligatory Prayers which superseded it.<p>

	  There is a well-known Islámic tradition concerning God and His creation:<p>
	  <a name="p175"/><blockquote>I was a Hidden Treasure. I wished to be made known, and thus I called creation into being in order that I might be known.</blockquote>
	  References and allusions to this tradition are found throughout the Bahá'i Writings. For example, in one of His prayers, Bahá'u'lláh reveals:
	  <blockquote><i>
	  Lauded be Thy name, O Lord my God! I testify that Thou wast a hidden Treasure wrapped within Thine immemorial Being and an impenetrable Mystery enshrined in Thine own Essence. Wishing to reveal Thyself, Thou didst call into being the Greater and the Lesser Worlds, and didst choose Man above all Thy creatures, and didst make Him a sign of both of these worlds, O Thou Who art our Lord, the Most Compassionate!<p>
	  Thou didst raise Him up to occupy Thy throne before all the people of Thy creation. Thou didst enable Him to unravel Thy mysteries, and to shine with the lights of Thine inspiration and Thy Revelation, and to manifest Thy names and Thine attributes. Through Him Thou didst adorn the preamble of the book of Thy creation, O Thou Who art the Ruler of the universe Thou hast fashioned! (Prayers and Meditations by Bahá'u'lláh,</i> <a href="../PM/p003-340.html#para168">XXXVIII</a>)
	  </blockquote>
	  Likewise, in the Hidden Words, He states:
	  <blockquote><i>O Son of Man! I loved thy creation, hence I created thee. Wherefore, do thou love Me, that I may name thy name and fill thy soul with the spirit of life.</i></blockquote>
	  'Abdu'l-Bahá, in His commentary on the above-cited tradition, wrote:
	  <blockquote><i>O wayfarer in the path of the Beloved! Know thou that the main purpose of this holy tradition is to make mention of the stages of God's concealment and manifestation within the Embodiments of Truth, They who are the Dawning-places of His All-Glorious Being. For example, before the flame of the undying Fire is lit and manifest, it existeth by itself within itself in the hidden <a name="p176"/> identity of the universal Manifestations, and this is the stage of the "Hidden Treasure". And when the blessed Tree is kindled by itself within itself, and that Divine Fire burneth by its essence within its essence, this is the stage of "I wished to be made known". And when it shineth forth from the Horizon of the universe with infinite Divine Names and Attributes upon the contingent and placeless worlds, this constituteth the emergence of a new and wondrous creation which correspondeth to the stage of "Thus I called creation into being". And when the sanctified souls rend asunder the veils of all earthly attachments and worldly conditions, and hasten to the stage of gazing on the beauty of the Divine Presence and are honoured by recognizing the Manifestation and are able to witness the splendour of God's Most Great Sign in their hearts, then will the purpose of creation, which is the knowledge of Him Who is the Eternal Truth, become manifest.</i></blockquote>

	  Fasting and obligatory prayer constitute the two pillars that sustain the revealed Law of God. Bahá'u'lláh in one of His Tablets affirms that He has revealed the laws of obligatory prayer and fasting so that through them the believers may draw nigh unto God.<p>
	  Shoghi Effendi indicates that the fasting period, which involves complete abstention from food and drink from sunrise till sunset, is
	  <blockquote>. . .essentially a period of meditation and prayer, of spiritual recuperation, during which the believer must strive to make the necessary readjustments in his inner life, and to refresh and reinvigorate the spiritual forces <a name="p177"/>	latent in his soul. Its significance and purpose are, therefore, fundamentally spiritual in character. Fasting is symbolic, and a reminder of abstinence from selfish and carnal desires.</blockquote>
	  Fasting is enjoined on all the believers once they attain the age of 15 and until they reach the age of 70 years.<p>
	  A summary of the detailed provisions concerning the law of fasting and of the exemptions granted to certain categories of people is contained in the Synopsis and Codification, section <a href="p141-164Synopsis.html#IV.B.1">IV.B.1.</a>-6.

According to this calendar, a day is the period from sunset to sunset. In the Bayán, the Báb ordained the month of Ala' to be the month of fasting, decreed that the day of Naw-Rúz should mark the termination of that period, and designated Naw-Rúz as the Day of God. Bahá'u'lláh confirms the Badí' calendar wherein Naw-Rúz is designated as a feast.<p>
	  Naw-Rúz is the first day of the new year. It coincides with the spring equinox in the northern hemisphere, which usually occurs on 21 March. Bahá'u'lláh explains that this feast day is to be celebrated on whatever day the sun passes into the constellation of Aries (i.e. the vernal equinox), even should this occur one minute before sunset (<a href="p103-140QA.html#qa35">Q&A 35</a>). Hence Naw-Rúz could fall on 20, 21, or 22 March, depending on the time of the equinox.<p>
	  Bahá'u'lláh has left the details of many laws to be filled <a name="p178"/> in by the Universal House of Justice. Among these are a number of matters affecting the Bahá'i calendar. The Guardian has stated that the implementation, worldwide, of the law concerning the timing of Naw-Rúz will require the choice of a particular spot on earth which will serve as the standard for the fixing of the time of the spring equinox. He also indicated that the choice of this spot has been left to the decision of the Universal House of Justice.<p>

	  "Alláh-u-Abhá" is an Arabic phrase meaning "God the All-Glorious". It is a form of the Greatest Name of God (see <a href="p165-251Notes.html#note137">note 137</a>). In Islám there is a tradition that among the many names of God, one was the greatest; however, the identity of this Greatest Name was hidden. Bahá'u'lláh has confirmed that the Greatest Name is "Bahá".<p>
	  The various derivatives of the word "Bahá" are also regarded as the Greatest Name. Shoghi Effendi's secretary writing on his behalf explains that
	  <blockquote>The Greatest Name is the Name of Bahá'u'lláh. "Yá Bahá'u'l-Abhá" is an invocation meaning: "O Thou Glory of Glories!". "Alláh-u-Abhá" is a greeting which means: "God the All-Glorious". Both refer to Bahá'u'lláh. By Greatest Name is meant that Bahá'u'lláh has appeared in God's Greatest Name, in other words, that He is the supreme Manifestation of God.</blockquote>
	  The greeting "Alláh-u-Abhá" was adopted during the period of Bahá'u'lláh's exile in Adrianople.<p>
	  The repetition of "Alláh-u-Abhá" ninety-five times is to be preceded by the performance of ablutions (see <a href="p165-251Notes.html#note34">note 34</a>).<p>

	  Ablutions are specifically associated with certain prayers. They must precede the offering of the three Obligatory Prayers, the daily recitation of "Alláh-u-Abhá" ninety-five times, and the recital of the verse prescribed as an alternative to obligatory prayer and fasting for women in their courses (see <a href="p165-251Notes.html#note20">note 20</a>).<p>

	  That ablutions have a significance beyond washing may be seen from the fact that even should one have bathed oneself immediately before reciting the Obligatory Prayer, it would still be necessary to perform ablutions (<a href="p103-140QA.html#qa18">Q&A 18</a>).<p>
	  When no water is available for ablutions, a prescribed verse is to be repeated five times (see <a href="p165-251Notes.html#note16">note 16</a>), and this provision is extended to those for whom the use of water would be physically harmful (<a href="p103-140QA.html#qa51">Q&A 51</a>).<p>

	  The Bahá'i laws of inheritance apply only in case of intestacy, that is, when the individual dies without leaving a will. In the Kitáb-i-Aqdas (<a href="p019-088Aqdas.html#para109">&para;109</a>), Bahá'u'lláh instructs every believer to write a will. He elsewhere clearly states that the individual has full jurisdiction over his property and is free to determine the manner in which his or her estate is to be divided and to designate, in the will, those, whether Bahá'i or non-Bahá'i, who should inherit (<a href="p103-140QA.html#qa69">Q&A 69</a>). In this connection, a letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi explains that:
	  <blockquote>. . . even though a Bahá'i is permitted in his will to dispose of his wealth in the way he wishes, yet he is morally and conscientiously bound to always bear in mind, while writing his will, the necessity of his upholding the principle of Bahá'u'lláh regarding the social function of wealth, and the consequent necessity of avoiding its over-accumulation and concentration in a few individuals or groups of individuals.</blockquote>
	  This verse of the Aqdas introduces a lengthy passage in which Bahá'u'lláh elaborates the Bahá'i law of inheritance.<p>
	  <a name="p183"/>In reading this passage one should bear in mind that the law is formulated with the presumption that the deceased is a man; its provisions apply, <i><span TITLE="Application of laws equally to both sexes.">mutatis mutandis</span></i>, when the deceased is a woman.<p>
	  The system of inheritance which provides for distribution of the deceased's estate among seven categories of heirs (children, spouse, father, mother, brothers, sisters, and teachers) is based on the provisions set out by the Báb in the Bayán. The major features of the Bahá'i laws of inheritance in the case of <span title="The situation of dying without a legally valid will.">intestacy</span> are:
			<ol type=1 start="" title="" compact>
			<li>If the deceased is a father and his estate includes a personal residence, such residence passes to the eldest son (<a href="p103-140QA.html#qa34">Q&A 34</a>).<p>
			<li>If the deceased has no male descendants, two thirds of the residence pass to his female descendants and the remaining third passes to the House of Justice (Q&A <a href="p103-140QA.html#qa41">41</a>, <a href="p103-140QA.html#qa72">72</a>). See <a href="p165-251Notes.html#note42">note 42</a> concerning the levels of the institution of the House of Justice to which this law applies. (See also <a href="p165-251Notes.html#note44">note 44</a>.)<p>
			<li>The remainder of the estate is divided among the seven categories of heirs. For details of the number of shares to be received by each group, see Questions and Answers, number <a href="p103-140QA.html#qa5">5</a>, and Synopsis and Codification, section <a href="p141-164Synopsis.html#IV.C.3">IV.C.3.</a>a.<p>
			<li>In case there is more than one heir in any category the share allotted to that class should be divided between them equally, be they male or female.<p>
			<li>In cases where there is no issue, the share of the children reverts to the House of Justice (Q&A <a href="p103-140QA.html#qa7">7</a>, <a href="p103-140QA.html#qa41">41</a>).<p>
			<li>Should one leave offspring, but either part or all of the other categories of heirs be non-existent, two thirds of their shares revert to the offspring and one third to the House of Justice (<a href="p103-140QA.html#qa7">Q&A 7</a>).<p>
			<li>Should none of the specified categories exist, two <a name="p184"/> thirds of the estate revert to the nephews and nieces of the deceased. If these do not exist, the same shares revert to the aunts and uncles; lacking these, to their sons and daughters. In any case the remaining third reverts to the House of Justice.</blockquote>
			<li>Should one leave none of the aforementioned heirs, the entire estate reverts to the House of Justice.<p>
			<li>Bahá'u'lláh states that non-Bahá'is have no right to inherit from their Bahá'i parents or relatives (<a href="p103-140QA.html#qa34">Q&A 34</a>). Shoghi Effendi in a letter written on his behalf indicates that this restriction applies "only to such cases when a Bahá'i dies without leaving a will and when, therefore, his property will have to be divided in accordance with the rules set forth in the Aqdas. Otherwise, a Bahá'i is free to bequeath his property to any person, irrespective of religion, provided however he leaves a will, specifying his wishes." It is always possible, therefore, for a Bahá'i to provide for his or her non-Bahá'i partner, children or relatives by leaving a will.<p>

	  In a Tablet, 'Abdu'l-Bahá indicates that the residence and personal clothing of a deceased man remain in the male line. They pass to the eldest son and in the absence of the eldest son, they pass to the second-eldest son, and so on. He explains that this provision is an expression of the law of primogeniture, which has invariably been upheld by the Law of God. In a Tablet to a follower of the Faith in Persia He wrote: <i>"In all the Divine Dispensations the eldest son hath been given extraordinary distinctions. Even the station of prophethood hath been his birthright."</i> With the distinctions given to the eldest son, however, go concomitant duties. For example, he has the moral responsibility, for the sake of God, to care for his mother and also to consider the needs of the other heirs.<p>
	  Bahá'u'lláh clarifies various aspects of this part of the law of inheritance. He specifies that if there be more than one residence, the principal and most important one passes to the male offspring. The remaining residences will, together with the other possessions of the deceased, have to be divided among the heirs (<a href="p103-140QA.html#qa34">Q&A 34</a>), and He indicates that in the absence of male offspring, two thirds of the <a name="p187"/> principal residence and the personal clothing of the deceased father will revert to the female issue and one third to the House of Justice (<a href="p103-140QA.html#qa72">Q&A 72</a>). Further, when the deceased is a woman, Bahá'u'lláh states that all her used clothing is to be equally divided amongst her daughters. Her unworn clothing, jewels and property must be divided among her heirs, as well as her used clothing if she leaves no daughter (<a href="p103-140QA.html#qa37">Q&A 37</a>).<p>

For this purpose, the definition of adult was temporarily fixed at the age of 21 years by the Guardian, who indicated it was open to change by the Universal House of Justice in the future.<p>
	  Local and Secondary Houses of Justice are, for the present, known as Local Spiritual Assemblies and National Spiritual Assemblies. Shoghi Effendi has indicated that this is a "temporary appellation" which,
	  <blockquote>. . . as the position and aims of the Bahá'i Faith are better understood and more fully recognized, will gradually be superseded by the permanent and more appropriate designation of House of Justice. Not only will the present-day Spiritual Assemblies be styled differently in future, but they will be enabled also to add to their present functions those powers, duties, and prerogatives necessitated by the recognition of the Faith of Bahá'u'lláh, not merely as one of the recognized religious systems of the world, but as the State Religion of an independent and Sovereign Power.</blockquote>

	  It is obligatory for men and women to engage in a trade or profession. Bahá'u'lláh exalts <i>"engagement in such work"</i> to the <i>"rank of worship"</i> of God. The spiritual and practical significance of this law, and the mutual responsibility of the individual and society for its implementation are explained in a letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi:
	  <blockquote>With reference to Bahá'u'lláh's command concerning the engagement of the believers in some sort of profession: the Teachings are most emphatic on this matter, particularly the statement in the Aqdas to this effect which makes it quite clear that idle people who lack the desire to work can have no place in the new World Order. As a corollary of this principle, Bahá'u'lláh further states that mendicity should not only be discouraged but entirely wiped out from the face of society. It is the duty of those who are in charge of the organization of society to give every individual the opportunity of acquiring the necessary talent in some kind of profession, and also the means of utilizing such a talent, both for its own sake and for the sake of earning the means of his livelihood. Every individual, no matter how handicapped and limited he may be, is under the obligation of engaging in some work or profession, for work, especially when performed in the spirit of service, is according to Bahá'u'lláh a form of worship. It has not only a utilitarian purpose, but has a value in itself, because it draws us nearer to God, and enables us to better grasp His purpose for us in this world. It is obvious, therefore, that the inheritance of wealth cannot make anyone immune from daily work.</blockquote>
	  <a name="p193"/>In one of His Tablets, 'Abdu'l-Bahá states that <i>"if a person is incapable of earning a living, is stricken by dire poverty or becometh helpless, then it is incumbent on the wealthy or the Deputies to provide him with a monthly allowance for his subsistence. . .. By 'Deputies' is meant the representatives of the people, that is to say the members of the House of Justice."</i> (See also <a href="p165-251Notes.html#note162">note 162</a> on mendicancy.)<p>
	  In response to a question concerning whether Bahá'u'lláh's injunction requires a wife and mother, as well as her husband, to work for a livelihood, the Universal House of Justice has explained that Bahá'u'lláh's directive is for the friends to be engaged in an occupation which will profit themselves and others, and that homemaking is a highly honourable and responsible work of fundamental importance to society.<p>
	  Concerning the retirement from work for individuals who have reached a certain age, Shoghi Effendi in a letter written on his behalf stated that "this is a matter on which the International House of Justice will have to legislate as there are no provisions in the Aqdas concerning it".<p>

	  Bahá'u'lláh prohibits confession to, and seeking absolution of one's sins from, a human being. Instead one should beg <a name="p194"/> forgiveness from God. In the Tablet of Bishárát, He states that <i>"such confession before people results in one's humiliation and abasement"</i>, and He affirms that God <i>"wisheth not the humiliation of His servants"</i>.<p>
	  Shoghi Effendi sets the prohibition into context. His secretary has written on his behalf that we<p>
	  <blockquote>. . . are forbidden to confess to any person, as do the Catholics to their priests, our sins and shortcomings, or to do so in public, as some religious sects do. However, if we spontaneously desire to acknowledge we have been wrong in something, or that we have some fault of character, and ask another person's forgiveness or pardon, we are quite free to do so.</blockquote>
	  The Universal House of Justice has also clarified that Bahá'u'lláh's prohibition concerning the confession of sins does not prevent an individual from admitting transgressions in the course of consultations held under the aegis of Bahá'i institutions. Likewise, it does not preclude the possibility of seeking advice from a close friend or of a professional counsellor regarding such matters.<p>

It has particular implications not only for the disposition of endowments but also for the succession of authority following the passing of Bahá'u'lláh (see <a href="p165-251Notes.html#note145">note 145</a>) and of 'Abdu'l-Bahá. Bahá'u'lláh, in the Book of His Covenant, appointed 'Abdu'l-Bahá, His eldest son, as the Centre of His Covenant and the Head of the Faith. 'Abdu'l-Bahá, in His Will and Testament, appointed <a name="p197"/> Shoghi Effendi, His eldest grandson, as the Guardian and Head of the Faith.<p>
	  This passage of the Aqdas, therefore, anticipates the succession of chosen Aghsán and thus the institution of the Guardianship and envisages the possibility of a break in their line. The passing of Shoghi Effendi in 1957 precipitated the very situation provided for in this passage, in that the line of Aghsán ended before the Universal House of Justice had been established (see <a href="p165-251Notes.html#note67">note 67</a>).<p>

He designated that in such a situation <i>"endowments shall revert to the people of Bahá"</i>. The term <i>"people of Bahá"</i> is used with a number of different meanings in the Bahá'i Writings. In this instance, they are described as those <i>"who speak not except by His leave and judge not save in accordance with what God hath decreed in this Tablet"</i>. Following the passing of Shoghi Effendi in 1957, the Hands of the Cause of God directed the affairs of the Cause until the election of the Universal House of Justice in 1963 (see <a href="p165-251Notes.html#note183">note 183</a>).<p>

	  Although the term translated here as adultery refers, in its broadest sense, to unlawful sexual intercourse between either married or unmarried individuals (see <a href="p165-251Notes.html#note36">note 36</a> for a definition of the term), 'Abdu'l-Bahá has specified that the punishment here prescribed is for sexual intercourse between persons who are unmarried. He indicates that it remains for the Universal House of Justice to determine the penalty for adultery committed by a married individual. (See also <a href="p103-140QA.html#qa49">Q&A 49</a>.)<p>
	  In one of His Tablets, 'Abdu'l-Bahá refers to some of the spiritual and social implications of the violation of the laws of morality and, concerning the penalty here described, He indicates that the aim of this law is to make clear to all that such an action is shameful in the eyes of God and that, in the event that the offence can be established and the fine imposed, the principal purpose is the exposure of the offenders--that they are shamed and disgraced in the eyes of society.

	  A mithqál is a unit of weight. The weight of the traditional mithqál used in the Middle East is equivalent to 24 <a name="p201"/> nakhuds.

The weight of nine of these mithqáls equals 32.775 grammes or 1.05374 troy ounces.<p>
	  In relation to the application of the fine, Bahá'u'lláh clearly specifies that each succeeding fine is double the preceding one (<a href="p103-140QA.html#qa23">Q&A 23</a>); thus the fine imposed increases in geometrical progression.

	  The law of Bahá'u'lláh prescribes the death penalty for murder and arson, with the alternative of life imprisonment (see <a href="p165-251Notes.html#note87">note 87</a>).<p>
	  In His Tablets 'Abdu'l-Bahá explains the difference between revenge and punishment. He affirms that individuals do not have the right to take revenge, that revenge is despised in the eyes of God, and that the motive for punishment is not vengeance, but the imposition of a penalty for the committed offence. In <a href="../../AB/SAQ/p261-306Part5.html#para27"><i>Some Answered Questions</i></a>, He confirms that it is the right of society to impose punishments on criminals for the purpose of protecting its members and defending its existence.<p>
	  <a name="p204"/>With regard to this provision, Shoghi Effendi in a letter written on his behalf gives the following explanation:
	  <blockquote>In the Aqdas Bahá'u'lláh has given death as the penalty for murder. However, He has permitted life imprisonment as an alternative. Both practices would be in accordance with His Laws. Some of us may not be able to grasp the wisdom of this when it disagrees with our own limited vision; but we must accept it, knowing His Wisdom, His Mercy and His Justice are perfect and for the salvation of the entire world. If a man were falsely condemned to die, can we not believe Almighty God would compensate him a thousandfold, in the next world, for this human injustice? You cannot give up a salutary law just because on rare occasions the innocent may be punished.</blockquote>
	  The details of the Bahá'i law of punishment for murder and arson, a law designed for a future state of society, were not specified by Bahá'u'lláh. The various details of the law, such as degrees of offence, whether extenuating circumstances are to be taken into account, and which of the two prescribed punishments is to be the norm are left to the Universal House of Justice to decide in light of prevailing conditions when the law is to be in operation. The manner in which the punishment is to be carried out is also left to the Universal House of Justice to decide.<p>
	  In relation to arson, this depends on what <i>"house"</i> is burned. There is obviously a tremendous difference in the degree of offence between the person who burns down an empty warehouse and one who sets fire to a school full of children.<p>

He elaborates this theme in a number of Tablets, including the following:<p>
	  <a name="p206"/><blockquote><i>Know thou that polygamy is not permitted under the law of God, for contentment with one wife hath been clearly stipulated. Taking a second wife is made dependent upon equity and justice being upheld between the two wives, under all conditions. However, observance of justice and equity towards two wives is utterly impossible. The fact that bigamy has been made dependent upon an impossible condition is clear proof of its absolute prohibition. Therefore it is not permissible for a man to have more than one wife.</i></blockquote>
	  Polygamy is a very ancient practice among the majority of humanity. The introduction of monogamy has been only gradually accomplished by the Manifestations of God. Jesus, for example, did not prohibit polygamy, but abolished divorce except in the case of fornication; Muhammad limited the number of wives to four, but making plurality of wives contingent on justice, and reintroducing permission for divorce; Bahá'u'lláh, Who was revealing His Teachings in the milieu of a Muslim society, introduced the question of monogamy gradually in accordance with the principles of wisdom and the progressive unfoldment of His purpose. The fact that He left His followers with an infallible Interpreter of His Writings enabled Him to outwardly permit two wives in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas but uphold a condition that enabled 'Abdu'l-Bahá to elucidate later that the intention of the law was to enforce monogamy.<p>

If a person has to wait a considerable period of time before finding a spouse, or ultimately must remain single, it does not mean that the individual is thereby unable to fulfil his or her life's purpose, which is fundamentally spiritual.<p>

	  The Synopsis and Codification, section <a href="p141-164Synopsis.html#IV.C.1.j">IV.C.1.j</a>.i.-v., summarizes the main provisions concerning the dowry. These provisions have their antecedents in the Bayán.<p>
	  <a name="p208"/>The dowry is to be paid by the bridegroom to the bride. It is fixed at 19 mithqáls of pure gold for city-dwellers, and 19 mithqáls of silver for village-dwellers (see <a href="p165-251Notes.html#note94">note 94</a>). Bahá'u'lláh indicates that, if, at the time of the wedding, the bridegroom is unable to pay the dowry in full, it is permissible for him to issue a promissory note to the bride (<a href="p103-140QA.html#qa39">Q&A 39</a>).<p>
	  With the Revelation of Bahá'u'lláh many familiar concepts, customs and institutions are redefined and take on new meaning. One of these is the dowry. The institution of dowry is a very ancient practice in many cultures and takes many forms. In some countries it is a payment made by the parents of the bride to the bridegroom; in others it is a payment made by the bridegroom to the parents of the bride, called a "bride-price". In both such cases the amount is often quite considerable. The law of Bahá'u'lláh abolishes all such variants and converts the dowry into a symbolic act whereby the bridegroom presents a gift of a certain limited value to the bride.<p>

	  In answer to a question about the dowry, Bahá'u'lláh stated:
	  <blockquote><i>Whatever is revealed in the Bayán, in respect to those residing in cities and villages, is approved and should be carried out. However, in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas mention is made of the lowest <a name="p209"/> level. The intention is nineteen mithqáls of silver, specified in the Bayán for village-dwellers. This is more pleasing unto God, provided the two parties agree. The purpose is to promote the comfort of all, and to bring about concord and union among the people. Therefore, the greater the consideration shown in these matters the better it will be. . . The people of Bahá must associate and deal with each other with the utmost love and sincerity. They should be mindful of the interests of all, especially the friends of God.</i></blockquote>
	  'Abdu'l-Bahá, in one of His Tablets, summarized some of the provisions for determining the level of the dowry. The unit of payment mentioned in the extract, cited below, is the "váhid". One váhid is equivalent to nineteen mithqáls. He stated:
	  <blockquote><i>City-dwellers must pay in gold and village-dwellers in silver. It dependeth on the financial means at the disposal of the groom. If he is poor, he payeth one váhid; if of modest means, he payeth two váhids; if well-to-do, three váhids; if wealthy, four váhids; and if very rich, he giveth five váhids. It is, in truth, a matter for agreement between the bridegroom, the bride, and their parents. Whatever agreement is reached should be carried out.</i></blockquote>
	  In this same Tablet, 'Abdu'l-Bahá encouraged the believers to refer questions concerning the application of this law to the Universal House of Justice, which has <i>"the authority to legislate"</i>. He stressed that <i>"it is this body which will enact laws and legislate upon secondary matters which are not explicit in the Holy Text"</i>.<p>

	  In the Tablet of Ishráqát Bahá'u'lláh, referring to the fact that the Báb had made the laws of the Bayán subject to His sanction, states that He put some of the Báb's laws into effect <i>"by embodying them in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas in different words"</i>, while others He set aside.<p>
	  <a name="p214"/>With regard to the destruction of books, the Bayán commanded the Báb's followers to destroy all books except those that were written in vindication of the Cause and Religion of God. Bahá'u'lláh abrogates this specific law of the Bayán.<p>
	  As to the nature and severity of the laws of the Bayán, Shoghi Effendi in a letter written on his behalf provides the following comment:
	  <blockquote>The severe laws and injunctions revealed by the Báb can be properly appreciated and understood only when interpreted in the light of His own statements regarding the nature, purpose and character of His own Dispensation. As these statements clearly reveal, the Bábí Dispensation was essentially in the nature of a religious and indeed social revolution, and its duration had therefore to be short, but full of tragic events, of sweeping and drastic reforms. Those drastic measures enforced by the Báb and His followers were taken with the view of undermining the very foundations of Shí'ih orthodoxy, and thus paving the way for the coming of Bahá'u'lláh. To assert the independence of the new Dispensation, and to prepare also the ground for the approaching Revelation of Bahá'u'lláh, the Báb had therefore to reveal very severe laws, even though most of them were never enforced. But the mere fact that He revealed them was in itself a proof of the independent character of His Dispensation and was sufficient to create such widespread agitation, and excite such opposition on the part of the clergy that led them to cause His eventual martyrdom.</blockquote>

	  In His Tablets Bahá'u'lláh counsels the believers to study such sciences and arts as are <i>"useful"</i> and would further <i>"the progress and advancement"</i> of society, and He cautions against sciences which <i>"begin with words and end with words"</i>, the pursuit of which leads to <i>"idle disputation"</i>. Shoghi Effendi, in a letter written on his behalf, likened sciences that "begin with words and end with words" to "fruitless excursions into metaphysical hair-splittings", and, in another letter, he explained that what Bahá'u'lláh primarily intended by such "sciences" are "those theological treatises and commentaries that encumber the human mind rather than help it to attain the truth".<p>

	  This verse establishes Huqúqu'lláh, the Right of God, the offering of a fixed portion of the value of the believer's possessions. This offering was made to Bahá'u'lláh as the Manifestation of God and then, following His Ascension, to 'Abdu'l-Bahá as the Centre of the Covenant. In His Will and Testament, 'Abdu'l-Bahá provided that the Huqúqu'lláh was to be offered <i>"through the Guardian of the Cause of God"</i>. There now being no Guardian, it is offered through the Universal House of Justice as the Head of the Faith. This fund is used for the promotion of the Faith of God and its interests as well as for various philanthropic purposes. The offering of the Huqúqu'lláh is a spiritual obligation, the fulfilment of which has been left to the conscience of each Bahá'i. While the community is reminded of the <a name="p219"/> requirements of the law of Huqúq, no believer may be approached individually to pay it.<p>
	  A number of items in Questions and Answers further elaborate this law. The payment of Huqúqu'lláh is based on the calculation of the value of the individual's possessions. If a person has possessions equal in value to at least nineteen mithqáls of gold (<a href="p103-140QA.html#qa8">Q&A 8</a>), it is a spiritual obligation to pay nineteen percent of the total amount, once only, as Huqúqu'lláh (<a href="p103-140QA.html#qa89">Q&A 89</a>). Thereafter, whenever one's income, after all expenses have been paid, increases the value of one's possessions by the amount of at least nineteen mithqáls of gold, one is to pay nineteen percent of this increase, and so on for each further increase (Q&A <a href="p103-140QA.html#qa8">8</a>, <a href="p103-140QA.html#qa90">90</a>).<p>
	  Certain categories of possessions, such as one's residence, are exempt from the payment of Huqúqu'lláh (Q&A <a href="p103-140QA.html#qa8">8</a>, <a href="p103-140QA.html#qa42">42</a>, <a href="p103-140QA.html#qa95">95</a>), and specific provisions are outlined to cover cases of financial loss (Q&A <a href="p103-140QA.html#qa44">44</a>, <a href="p103-140QA.html#qa45">45</a>), the failure of investments to yield a profit (<a href="p103-140QA.html#qa102">Q&A 102</a>) and for the payment of Huqúq in the event of the person's death (Q&A <a href="p103-140QA.html#qa9">9</a>, <a href="p103-140QA.html#qa69">69</a>, <a href="p103-140QA.html#qa80">80</a>). (In this latter case, see <a href="p165-251Notes.html#note47">note 47</a>.)<p>

Even after its revelation the Aqdas was withheld by Him for some time before it was sent to the friends in Persia. This divinely purposed delay in the revelation of the basic laws of God for this age, and the subsequent gradual implementation of their provisions, illustrate the principle of progressive revelation which applies even within the ministry of each Prophet.<p>

	  In several of His Tablets, Bahá'u'lláh affirms the distinction between allegorical verses, which are susceptible to interpretation, and those verses that relate to such subjects as the laws and ordinances, worship and religious observances, whose meanings are evident and which demand compliance on the part of the believers.<p>
	  As explained in notes <a href="p165-251Notes.html#note145">145</a> and <a href="p165-251Notes.html#note184">184</a>, Bahá'u'lláh designated 'Abdu'l-Bahá, His eldest Son, as His Successor and the Interpreter of His Teachings. 'Abdu'l-Bahá in His turn appointed His eldest grandson, Shoghi Effendi, to succeed Him as interpreter of the holy Writ and Guardian of the Cause. The interpretations of 'Abdu'l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi are considered divinely guided and are binding on the Bahá'is.<p>
	  The existence of authoritative interpretations does not preclude the individual from engaging in the study of the Teachings and thereby arriving at a personal interpretation or understanding. A clear distinction is, however, drawn in the Bahá'i Writings between authoritative interpretation and the understanding that each individual arrives at from a study of its Teachings. Individual interpretations based on a person's understanding of the Teachings constitute the fruit of man's rational power and may well contribute to a greater comprehension of the Faith. Such views, nevertheless, lack authority. In presenting their personal ideas, individuals are cautioned not to discard the authority of the revealed words, not to deny or contend with the authoritative interpretation, and not to engage in controversy; rather they should <a name="p221"/> offer their thoughts as a contribution to knowledge, making it clear that their views are merely their own.<p>

	  Bahá'u'lláh prohibits the use of the pools found in the traditional public bath-houses of Persia. In these baths it was the custom for many people to wash themselves in the same pool and for the water to be changed at infrequent intervals. Consequently, the water was discoloured, befouled and unhygienic, and had a highly offensive stench.<p>

	  Most houses in Persia used to have a pool in their courtyard which served as a reservoir for water used for cleaning, washing and other domestic purposes. Since the water in the pool was stagnant and was not usually changed for weeks at a time, it tended to develop a very unpleasant odour.<p>

	  Marriage with one's stepmother is here explicitly prohibited. This prohibition also applies to marrying one's stepfather.

	  'Abdu'l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi confirmed that, while stepmothers are the only category of relatives mentioned in the text, this does not mean that all other unions within a family are permissible. Bahá'u'lláh states that it devolves upon the House of Justice to legislate "concerning the legitimacy or otherwise of marrying one's relatives" (<a href="p103-140QA.html#qa50">Q&A 50</a>). 'Abdu'l-Bahá has written that the more distant the blood-relationship between the couple the <a name="p223"/> better, since such marriages provide the basis for the physical well-being of humanity and are conducive to fellowship among mankind.<p>

	  The word translated here as <i>"boys"</i> has, in this context, in the Arabic original, the implication of paederasty. Shoghi Effendi has interpreted this reference as a prohibition on all homosexual relations.<p>
	  The Bahá'i teachings on sexual morality centre on marriage and the family as the bedrock of the whole structure of human society and are designed to protect and strengthen that divine institution. Bahá'i law thus restricts permissible sexual intercourse to that between a man and the woman to whom he is married.<p>
	  In a letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi it is stated:<p>
	  <blockquote>No matter how devoted and fine the love may be between people of the same sex, to let it find expression in sexual acts is wrong. To say that it is ideal is no excuse. Immorality of every sort is really forbidden by Bahá'u'lláh, and homosexual relationships He looks upon as such, besides being against nature. To be afflicted this way is a great burden to a conscientious soul. But through the advice and help of doctors, through a strong and determined effort, and through prayer, a soul can overcome this handicap.</blockquote>
	  Bahá'u'lláh makes provision for the Universal House of Justice to determine, according to the degree of the offence, penalties for adultery and sodomy (<a href="p103-140QA.html#qa49">Q&A 49</a>).<p>

	  This passage establishes four great festivals of the Bahá'i year. The two designated by Bahá'u'lláh as <i>"the two Most Great Festivals"</i> are, first, the Festival of Ridván, which commemorates Bahá'u'lláh's Declaration of His Prophetic Mission in the Garden of Ridván in Baghdád during twelve days in April/May 1863 and is referred to by Him as <i>"the <a name="p225"/> King of Festivals"</i> and, second, the Báb's Declaration, which occurred in May 1844 in Shíráz. The first, ninth and twelfth days of the Festival of Ridván are Holy Days (<a href="p103-140QA.html#qa1">Q&A 1</a>), as is the day of the Declaration of the Báb.<p>
	  The <i>"two other Festivals"</i> are the anniversaries of the births of Bahá'u'lláh and the Báb. In the Muslim lunar calendar these fall on consecutive days, the birth of Bahá'u'lláh on the second day of the month of Muharram 1233 A.H. (12 November 1817), and the birth of the Báb on the first day of the same month 1235 A.H. (20 October 1819), respectively. They are thus referred to as the "Twin Birthdays" and Bahá'u'lláh states that these two days are accounted as one in the sight of God (<a href="p103-140QA.html#qa2">Q&A 2</a>). He states that, should they fall within the month of fasting, the command to fast shall not apply on those days (<a href="p103-140QA.html#qa36">Q&A 36</a>). Given that the Bahá'i calendar (see <a href="p165-251Notes.html#note26">notes 26</a> and <a href="p165-251Notes.html#note147">147</a>) is a solar calendar, it remains for the Universal House of Justice to determine whether the Twin Holy Birthdays are to be celebrated on a solar or lunar basis.<p>

	  In the Bahá'i calendar the first month of the year and the first day of each month are given the name "Bahá". The day of Bahá of the month of Bahá is thus the Bahá'i New Year, Naw-Rúz, which was ordained by the Báb as a festival and is here confirmed by Bahá'u'lláh (see <a href="p165-251Notes.html#note26">notes 26</a> and <a href="p165-251Notes.html#note147">147</a>).<p>
	  In addition to the seven Holy Days ordained in these passages of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, the anniversary of the Martyrdom of the Báb was also commemorated as a Holy Day in the lifetime of Bahá'u'lláh and, as a corollary to this, 'Abdu'l-Bahá added the observance of the Ascension of Bahá'u'lláh, making nine Holy Days in all. Two other anniversaries which are observed, but on which work is not suspended, are the Day of the Covenant and the anniversary of the Passing of 'Abdu'l-Bahá.

	  Shoghi Effendi, in letters written on his behalf, states that this prohibition includes not only the consumption of wine but of "everything that deranges the mind", and he clarifies that the use of alcohol is permitted only when it constitutes part of a medical treatment which is implemented "under the advice of a competent and conscientious physician, who may have to prescribe it for the cure of some special ailment".<p>

	  <a name="p229"/>In brief, the Bahá'i law for the burial of the dead states that it is forbidden to carry the body for more than one hour's journey from the place of death; that the body should be wrapped in a shroud of silk or cotton, and on its finger should be placed a ring bearing the inscription <i>"I came forth from God, and return unto Him, detached from all save Him, holding fast to His Name, the Merciful, the Compassionate"</i>; and that the coffin should be of crystal, stone or hard fine wood. A specific Prayer for the Dead (see <a href="p165-251Notes.html#note10">note 10</a>) is ordained, to be said before interment. As affirmed by 'Abdu'l-Bahá and the Guardian, this law precludes cremation of the dead. The formal prayer and the ring are meant to be used for those who have attained the age of maturity, i.e. 15 years of age (<a href="p103-140QA.html#qa70">Q&A 70</a>).<p>
	  With regard to the material from which the coffin is to be made, the spirit of the law is that coffins should be of as durable a material as possible. Hence, the Universal House of Justice has explained that, in addition to the materials specified in the Aqdas, there is no objection to using the hardest wood available or concrete for the casket. For the present, the Bahá'is are left free to make their own choices in this matter.<p>

	  In the Bayán, the Báb specified that the body of the deceased should be wrapped in five sheets of silk or cotton. Bahá'u'lláh confirmed this provision and added the stipulation that for <i>"those whose means are limited a single sheet of either fabric will suffice"</i>.<p>
	  When asked whether the <i>"five sheets"</i> mentioned in the law referred to "five full-length shrouds" or "five cloths which were hitherto customarily used", Bahá'u'lláh re<a name="p230"/>sponded that the intention is the <i>"use of five cloths"</i> (<a href="p103-140QA.html#qa56">Q&A 56</a>).<p>

	  The passage of the Bayán which Bahá'u'lláh here quotes draws the attention of the believers to the imminence of the coming of "Him Whom God will make manifest". Its prohibition of marriage with a non-Bábí and its provision that the property of a husband or wife who embraced the Faith could not lawfully pass to the non-Bábí spouse were explicitly held in abeyance by the Báb, and were subsequently annulled by Bahá'u'lláh before they could come into effect. Bahá'u'lláh, in quoting this law, points to the fact that, in revealing it, the Báb had clearly anticipated the possibility that the Cause of Bahá'u'lláh would rise to prominence before that of the Báb Himself.<p>
	  In <i>God Passes By</i> Shoghi Effendi points out that the Bayán "should be regarded primarily as a eulogy of the Promised One rather than a code of laws and ordinances designed to be a permanent guide to future generations". "Designedly severe in the rules and regulations it imposed," he continues, "revolutionizing in the principles it instilled, calculated to awaken from their age-long torpor the clergy and the people, and to administer a sudden and fatal blow to obsolete and corrupt institutions, it proclaimed, through its drastic provisions, the advent of the anticipated Day, the Day when 'the Summoner shall summon to a stern business', when He will 'demolish whatever hath been before Him, even as the Apostle of God demolished the ways of those that preceded Him'" (see also <a href="p165-251Notes.html#note109">note 109</a>).<p>

	  The Bahá'i Writings contain many passages that elucidate the nature of the Manifestation and His relationship to God. Bahá'u'lláh underlines the unique and transcendent nature of the Godhead. He explains that <i>"since there can be no tie of direct intercourse to bind the one true God with His creation"</i> God ordains that <i>"in every age and dispensation a pure and stainless Soul be made manifest in the kingdoms of earth and heaven"</i>. This <i>"mysterious and ethereal Being"</i>, the Manifestation of God, has a human nature which pertains to <i>"the world of matter"</i> and a spiritual nature <i>"born of the substance of God Himself"</i>. He is also endowed with a <i>"double station"</i>:<p>
	  <i><blockquote>The first station, which is related to His innermost reality, representeth Him as One Whose voice is the voice of God Himself. . . The second station is the human station, exemplified by the following verses: "I am but a man like you." "Say, praise be to my Lord! Am I more than a man, an apostle?"</blockquote></i>
	  Bahá'u'lláh also affirms that, in the spiritual realm, there is an <i>"essential unity"</i> between all the Manifestations of God. They all reveal the <i>"Beauty of God"</i>, manifest His names and attributes, and give utterance to His Revelation. In this regard, He states:<p>
	  <i><blockquote>Were any of the all-embracing Manifestations of God to declare: "I am God", He, verily, speaketh the truth, and no doubt attacheth thereto. For it hath been repeatedly demonstrated that through their Revelation, their attributes and names, the Revelation of God, His names and His attributes, are made manifest in the world. . .</blockquote></i>
	  While the Manifestations reveal the names and attributes of God and are the means by which humanity has access to the knowledge of God and His Revelation, Shoghi Effendi states that the Manifestations should "never . . . be identified with that invisible Reality, the Essence of Divinity itself". In relation to Bahá'u'lláh, the Guardian wrote that the "human temple that has been the vehicle of <a name="p234"/> so overpowering a Revelation" is not to be identified with the "Reality" of God.<p>
	  Concerning the uniqueness of Bahá'u'lláh's station and the greatness of His Revelation, Shoghi Effendi affirms that the prophetic statements concerning the "Day of God", found in the Sacred Scriptures of past Dispensations, are fulfilled by the advent of Bahá'u'lláh:<p>
	  <blockquote>To Israel He was neither more nor less than the incarnation of the "Everlasting Father", the "Lord of Hosts" come down "with ten thousands of saints"; to Christendom Christ returned "in the glory of the Father"; to Shi'ah Islám the return of the Imám Husayn; to Sunní Islám the descent of the "Spirit of God" (Jesus Christ); to the Zoroastrians the promised Sháh-Bahrám; to the Hindus the reincarnation of Krishna; to the Buddhists the fifth Buddha.</blockquote>
	  Bahá'u'lláh describes the station of "Divinity" which He shares with all the Manifestations of God as<p>
	  <i><blockquote>. . . the station in which one dieth to himself and liveth in God. Divinity, whenever I mention it, indicateth My complete and absolute self-effacement. This is the station in which I have no control over mine own weal or woe nor over my life nor over my resurrection.</blockquote></i>
	  And, regarding His own relationship to God, He testifies:<p>
	  <i><blockquote>When I contemplate, O my God, the relationship that bindeth me to Thee, I am moved to proclaim to all created things "verily I am God"; and when I consider my own self, lo, I find it coarser than clay!</blockquote></i>

	  Zákat is referred to in the Qur'án as a regular charity binding upon Muslims. In due course the concept evolved into a form of alms-tax which imposed the obligation to give a fixed portion of certain categories of income, beyond specified limits, for the relief of the poor, for various charitable purposes, and to aid the Faith of God. The limit <a name="235"/> of exemption varied for different commodities, as did the percentage payable on the portion assessable.<p>
	  Bahá'u'lláh states that the Bahá'i law of Zákat follows <i>"what hath been revealed in the Qur'án"</i> (<a href="p103-140QA.html#qa107">Q&A 107</a>). Since such issues as the limits for exemption, the categories of income concerned, the frequency of payments, and the scale of rates for the various categories of Zákat are not mentioned in the Qur'án, these matters will have to be set forth in the future by the Universal House of Justice. Shoghi Effendi has indicated that pending such legislation the believers should, according to their means and possibilities, make regular contributions to the Bahá'i Fund.<p>

	  In a Tablet 'Abdu'l-Bahá expounds the meaning of this verse. He states that <i>"mendicancy is forbidden and that giving charity to people who take up begging as their profession is also prohibited"</i>.

	  In comments on this law, 'Abdu'l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi have made it clear that in the Mashriqu'l-Adhkár (where sermons are prohibited and only the words of Holy Scripture may be read) the reader may stand or sit, and if necessary to be better heard, may use a low moveable platform, but that no pulpit is permitted. In the case of meetings in places other than the Mashriqu'l-Adhkár, it is also permissible for the reader or speaker to sit or stand, and to use a platform. In one of His Tablets, when reiterating the prohibition of the use of pulpits in any location, 'Abdu'l-Bahá has stressed that when Bahá'is deliver their speeches in gatherings, they are to do so in an attitude of utmost humility and self-abnegation.<p>

	  This prohibition of the use of opium is reiterated by Bahá'u'lláh in the final paragraph of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas. In this connection, Shoghi Effendi stated that one of the requirements for "a chaste and holy life" is "total abstinence . . . from opium, and from similar habit-forming drugs". Heroin, hashish and other derivatives of cannabis such as marijuana, as well as hallucinogenic agents such as LSD, peyote and similar substances, are regarded as falling under this prohibition.<p>
	  'Abdu'l-Bahá has written:<p>
	  <i><blockquote>As to opium, it is foul and accursed. God protect us from the punishment He inflicteth on the user. According to the explicit Text of the Most Holy Book, it is forbidden, and its use is utterly condemned. Reason showeth that smoking opium is a kind of insanity, and experience attesteth that the user is completely cut off from the human kingdom. May God protect all against the perpetration of an act so hideous as this, an act which layeth in ruins the very foundation of what it is to be human, and which causeth the user to be dispossessed for ever and ever. For opium fasteneth on the soul so that the user's conscience dieth, his mind is blotted away, his perceptions are eroded. It turneth the living into the dead. It quencheth the natural heat. No greater harm can be conceived than that which opium inflicteth. Fortunate are they who never even speak the name of it; then think how wretched is the user.</blockquote></i>
	  <a name="p239"/><i><blockquote>O ye lovers of God! In this, the cycle of Almighty God, violence and force, constraint and oppression, are one and all condemned. It is, however, mandatory that the use of opium be prevented by any means whatsoever, that perchance the human race may be delivered from this most powerful of plagues. And otherwise, woe and misery to whoso falleth short of his duty to his Lord.</blockquote></i>
	  In one of His Tablets 'Abdu'l-Bahá has stated concerning opium: <i>"the user, the buyer and the seller are all deprived of the bounty and grace of God"</i>.<p>
	  In yet another Tablet, 'Abdu'l-Bahá has written:<p>
	  <i><blockquote>
	  Regarding hashish you have pointed out that some Persians have become habituated to its use. Gracious God! This is the worst of all intoxicants, and its prohibition is explicitly revealed. Its use causeth the disintegration of thought and the complete torpor of the soul. How could anyone seek the fruit of the infernal tree, and by partaking of it, be led to exemplify the qualities of a monster? How could one use this forbidden drug, and thus deprive himself of the blessings of the All-Merciful?<p>
	  Alcohol consumeth the mind and causeth man to commit acts of absurdity, but this opium, this foul fruit of the infernal tree, and this wicked hashish extinguish the mind, freeze the spirit, petrify the soul, waste the body and leave man frustrated and lost.
	  </blockquote></i><p>
	  It should be noted that the above prohibition against taking certain classes of drugs does not forbid their use when prescribed by qualified physicians as part of a medical treatment.<p>

	  Shaykh Ahmad-i-Ahsá'í (1753-1831), who was the founder of the Shaykhí School and the first of the "twin luminaries that heralded the advent of the Faith of the Báb", prophesied that at the appearance of the Promised One all things would be reversed, the last would be first, the first <a name="p240"/> last. Bahá'u'lláh in one of His Tablets refers to the <i>"symbol and allusion"</i> of the <i>"mystery of the Great Reversal in the Sign of the Sovereign"</i>. He states: <i>"Through this reversal He hath caused the exalted to be abased and the abased to be exalted"</i>, and He recalls that <i>"in the days of Jesus, it was those who were distinguished for their learning, the men of letters and religion, who denied Him, whilst humble fishermen made haste to gain admittance into the Kingdom"</i> (see also <a href="p165-251Notes.html#note172">note 172</a>).

	  In his writings, Shaykh Ahmad-i-Ahsá'í placed great emphasis on the Arabic letter "Váv". In <i>The Dawn-Breakers</i>, Nabíl states that this letter "symbolized for the Báb the advent of a new cycle of Divine Revelation, and has since been alluded to by Bahá'u'lláh in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas in such passages as <i>'the mystery of the Great Reversal'</i> and <i>'the Sign of the Sovereign'</i> ".<p>
	  The name for the letter "Váv" consists of three letters: Váv, Alif, Váv. According to the abjad reckoning, the numerical value of each of these letters is 6, 1 and 6 respectively. Shoghi Effendi in a letter written on his behalf to one of the believers in the East provides an interpretation of this verse of the Aqdas. He states that the <i>"Upright Alif"</i> refers to the advent of the Báb. The first letter with its value of six, which comes before the Alif, is a symbol of earlier Dispensations and Manifestations which predate the Báb, while the third letter, which also has a numerical value of six, stands for Bahá'u'lláh's supreme Revelation which was made manifest after the Alif.<p>

	  Bahá'u'lláh confirms an injunction contained in the Bayán which makes it unlawful to carry arms, unless it is necessary <a name="p241"/> to do so. With regard to circumstances under which the bearing of arms might be <i>"essential"</i> for an individual, 'Abdu'l-Bahá gives permission to a believer for self-protection in a dangerous environment. Shoghi Effendi in a letter written on his behalf has also indicated that, in an emergency, when there is no legal force at hand to appeal to, a Bahá'i is justified in defending his life. There are a number of other situations in which weapons are needed and can be legitimately used; for instance, in countries where people hunt for their food and clothing, and in such sports as archery, marksmanship, and fencing.<p>
	  On the societal level, the principle of collective security enunciated by Bahá'u'lláh (see <i>Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá'u'lláh</i>, <a href="../GL/p003-346.html#CXVII">CXVII</a>) and elaborated by Shoghi Effendi (see the Guardian's letters in <i>The World Order of Bahá'u'lláh</i>) does not presuppose the abolition of the use of force, but prescribes "a system in which Force is made the servant of Justice", and which provides for the existence of an international peace-keeping force that "will safeguard the organic unity of the whole commonwealth". In the Tablet of Bishárát, Bahá'u'lláh expresses the hope that <i>"weapons of war throughout the world may be converted into instruments of reconstruction and that strife and conflict may be removed from the midst of men"</i>.<p>
	  In another Tablet Bahá'u'lláh stresses the importance of fellowship with the followers of all religions; He also states that <i>"the law of holy war hath been blotted out from the Book"</i>.<p>

	  Bahá'u'lláh removed such limitations on one's apparel and beard. He leaves such matters to the <i>"discretion"</i> of the individual, and at the same time calls upon the believers not to transgress the bounds of propriety and to exercise moderation in all that pertains to dress.<p>

	  Bahá'u'lláh cautions people <i>"of insight"</i> not to allow their interpretations of the Holy Scriptures to prevent them from recognizing the Manifestation of God. Followers of each religion have tended to allow their devotion to its Founder to cause them to perceive His Revelation as the final Word of God and to deny the possibility of the appearance of any subsequent Prophet. This has been the case of Judaism, Christianity and Islám. Bahá'u'lláh denies the validity of this concept of finality both in relation to past Dispensations and to His own. With regard to Muslims, He wrote in the Kitáb-i-Íqán that the <i>"people of the Qur'án . . . have allowed the words 'Seal of the Prophets' to veil their eyes"</i>, <i>"to obscure their <a name="p244"/> understanding, and deprive them of the grace of all His manifold bounties"</i>. He affirms that <i>"this theme hath . . . been a sore test unto all mankind"</i>, and laments the fate of <i>"those who, clinging unto these words, have disbelieved in Him Who is their true Revealer"</i>. The Báb refers to this same theme when He warns: <i>"Let not names shut you out as by a veil from Him Who is their Lord, even the name Prophet, for such a name is but a creation of His utterance."</i><p>

	  Bahá'u'lláh eulogizes the learned among His followers. In the Book of His Covenant, He wrote: <i>"Blessed are the rulers and learned among the people of Bahá."</i> Referring to this statement, Shoghi Effendi has written:<p>
	  <blockquote>In this holy cycle the <i>"learned"</i> are, on the one hand, the Hands of the Cause of God, and, on the other, the teachers and diffusers of His Teachings who do not rank as Hands, but who have attained an eminent position in the teaching work. As to the <i>"rulers"</i> they refer to the members of the Local, National and International Houses of Justice. The duties of each of these souls will be determined in the future.</blockquote>
	  The Hands of the Cause of God were individuals appointed by Bahá'u'lláh and charged with various duties, especially those of protecting and propagating His Faith. In <i>Memorials of the Faithful</i> 'Abdu'l-Bahá referred to other outstanding believers as Hands of the Cause, and in His Will and Testament He included a provision calling upon the Guardian of the Faith to appoint Hands of the Cause at his discretion. Shoghi Effendi first raised posthumously a number of the believers to the rank of Hands of the Cause, and during the latter years of his life appointed a total of 32 believers from all continents to this position. In the period between the passing of Shoghi Effendi in 1957 and the <a name="p246"/> election of the Universal House of Justice in 1963, the Hands of the Cause directed the affairs of the Faith in their capacity as Chief Stewards of Bahá'u'lláh's embryonic World Commonwealth (see <a href="p165-251Notes.html#note67">note 67</a>). In November 1964, the Universal House of Justice determined that it could not legislate to make it possible to appoint Hands of the Cause. Instead, by a decision of the House of Justice in 1968, the functions of the Hands of the Cause in relation to protecting and propagating the Faith were extended into the future by the creation of the Continental Boards of Counsellors, and in 1973 through the establishment of the International Teaching Centre, which has its seat in the Holy Land.<p>
	  The Universal House of Justice appoints the Counsellor members of the International Teaching Centre and the Continental Counsellors. Members of Auxiliary Boards are appointed by the Continental Counsellors. All these individuals fall within the definition of the <i>"learned"</i> given by Shoghi Effendi in the statement quoted above.<p>

	  Bahá'u'lláh here explains that the reference is to events transpiring in the spiritual worlds beyond this plane of existence.<p>

	  The imperative "Be" in the original Arabic is the word "kun", consisting of the two letters "káf" and "nún". They have been translated by Shoghi Effendi in the above manner. This word has been used in the Qur'án as God's bidding calling creation into being.<p>

	  In the Persian Bayán, the Báb stated: <i>"Well is it with him who fixeth his gaze upon the Order of Bahá'u'lláh, and rendereth thanks unto his Lord. For He will assuredly be made manifest. God hath indeed irrevocably ordained it in the Bayán."</i> Shoghi Effendi identifies this <i>"Order"</i> with the System Bahá'u'lláh <a name="p248"/> envisages in the Aqdas, in which He testifies to its revolutionizing effect on the life of humanity and reveals the laws and principles which govern its operation.<p>
	  The features of the <i>"new World Order"</i> are delineated in the Writings of Bahá'u'lláh and 'Abdu'l-Bahá and in the letters of Shoghi Effendi and the Universal House of Justice. The institutions of the present-day Bahá'i Administrative Order, which constitute the "structural basis" of Bahá'u'lláh's World Order, will mature and evolve into the Bahá'i World Commonwealth. In this regard, Shoghi Effendi affirms that the Administrative Order "will, as its component parts, its organic institutions, begin to function with efficiency and vigour, assert its claim and demonstrate its capacity to be regarded not only as the nucleus but the very pattern of the New World Order destined to embrace in the fullness of time the whole of mankind".<p>
	  For additional information on the evolution of this new World Order, see, for example, the letters of Shoghi Effendi published in <i>The World Order of Bahá'u'lláh</i>.<p>

	  This is a reference to Mírzá Yahyá, known as Subh-i-Azal (Morning of Eternity), a younger half-brother of Bahá'u'lláh, who arose against Him and opposed His Cause. Mírzá Yahyá was nominated by the Báb to serve as a figure-head for the Bábí community pending the imminent manifestation of the Promised One. At the instigation of Siyyid Muhammad-i-Isfáhání (see <a href="p165-251Notes.html#note192">note 192</a>), Mírzá Yahyá betrayed the trust of the Báb, claimed to be His successor, and intrigued against Bahá'u'lláh, even attempting to have Him murdered. When Bahá'u'lláh formally declared His Mission to him in Adrianople, Mírzá Yahyá responded by going to the length of putting forward his own claim to be the recipient of an independent Revelation. His pretensions were eventually rejected by all but a few, who became known as Azalís (see <a href="p165-251Notes.html#note177">note 177</a>). He is described by Shoghi <a name="p249"/> Effendi as the "Arch-Breaker of the Covenant of the Báb" (see <i>God Passes By</i>, <a href="../../SE/GPB/p087-234SecondPeriod.html#p163">chapter X</a>).<p>

	  A reference to Siyyid Muhammad-i-Isfáhání, who is described by Shoghi Effendi as the "Antichrist of the Bahá'i Revelation". He was a man of corrupt character and great personal ambition who induced Mírzá Yahyá to oppose Bahá'u'lláh and to claim prophethood for himself (see <a href="p165-251Notes.html#note190">note 190</a>). Although he was an adherent of Mírzá Yahyá, Siyyid Muhammad was exiled with Bahá'u'lláh to 'Akká. He continued to agitate and plot against Bahá'u'lláh. In describing the circumstances of his death, Shoghi Effendi has written in <i>God Passes By</i>:<p>
	  <blockquote>
	  A fresh danger now clearly threatened the life of Bahá'u'lláh. Though He Himself had stringently forbidden His followers, on several occasions, both verbally and in writing, any retaliatory acts against their tormentors, and had even sent back to Beirut an irresponsible Arab convert, who had meditated avenging the wrongs suffered by his beloved Leader, seven of the companions clandestinely sought out and slew three of their persecutors, among whom were Siyyid Muhammad and Aqa Jan.<p>
	  The consternation that seized an already oppressed community was indescribable. Bahá'u'lláh's indignation knew no bounds. <i>"Were We"</i>, He thus voices His emotions, in a Tablet revealed shortly after this act had <a name="p250"/> been committed, <i>"to make mention of what befell Us, the heavens would be rent asunder and the mountains would crumble." "My captivity"</i>, He wrote on another occasion, <i>"cannot harm Me. That which can harm Me is the conduct of those who love Me, who claim to be related to Me, and yet perpetrate what causeth My heart and My pen to groan."</i>

	  Bahá'u'lláh enjoins the adoption of a universal language and script. His Writings envisage two stages in this process. The first stage is to consist of the selection of an existing language or an invented one which would then be taught in all the schools of the world as an auxiliary to the mother tongues. The governments of the world through their parliaments are called upon to effect this momentous enactment. The second stage, in the distant future, would be the eventual adoption of one single language and common script for all on earth.<p>

	  The first sign of the coming of age of humanity referred to in the Writings of Bahá'u'lláh is the emergence of a science which is described as that <i>"divine philosophy"</i> which will include the discovery of a radical approach to the transmutation of elements. This is an indication of the splendours of the future stupendous expansion of knowledge.<p>
	  Concerning the <i>"second"</i> sign which Bahá'u'lláh indicates to have been revealed in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, Shoghi Effendi states that Bahá'u'lláh, ". . .in His Most Holy Book, has enjoined the selection of a single language and the adoption of a common script for all on earth to use, an injunction which, when carried out, would, as He Himself affirms in that Book, be one of the signs of the <i>'coming of age of the human race'</i> ".<p>
	  <a name="p251"/>Further insight into this process of mankind's coming of age and proceeding to maturity is provided by the following statement of Bahá'u'lláh:<p>
	  <blockquote><i>One of the signs of the maturity of the world is that no one will accept to bear the weight of kingship. Kingship will remain with none willing to bear alone its weight. That day will be the day whereon wisdom will be manifested among mankind.</i></blockquote>
	  The coming of age of the human race has been associated by Shoghi Effendi with the unification of the whole of mankind, the establishment of a world commonwealth, and an unprecedented stimulus to "the intellectual, the moral and spiritual life of the entire human race".
