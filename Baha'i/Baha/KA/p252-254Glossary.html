	   <blockquote>Literally the "Gate", the title assumed by Mírzá 'Alí-Muhammad (1819-1850) after the Declaration of His Mission in Shíráz in May 1844.  He was the Founder of the Bábí Faith and the Herald of Bahá'u'lláh.</blockquote>

	   <blockquote>Bahá means Glory.  It is the Greatest Name of God and a title by which Bahá'u'lláh is designated.  Also, the name of the first month of the Bahá'i year and of the first day of each Bahá'i month.</blockquote>

	   <blockquote>The Bayán ("Exposition") is the title given by the Báb to His Book of Laws, and it is also applied to the entire body of His Writings.  The Persian Bayán is the major doctrinal work and principal repository of the laws ordained by the Báb.  The Arabic Bayán is parallel in content but smaller and less weighty.  References in the annotations to subjects found in both the Persian Bayán and the Arabic Bayán are identified by use of the term "Bayán" without further qualification.</blockquote>

	   <blockquote>The "Right of God".  Instituted in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, it is an offering made by the Bahá'is through the Head of the Faith for the purposes specified in the Bahá'i Writings.</blockquote>  
	   <a name="Mashriqu'l-Adhkár"></a><b>Mashriqu'l-Adhkár</b>
	   <blockquote>Literally "the Dawning-place of the praise of God", the designation of the Bahá'i House of Worship and its dependencies.</blockquote>
	   <a name="Mithqál"></a><b>Mithqál</b>
	   <blockquote>
	   A unit of weight, equivalent to a little over 3 1/2 grammes, used in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas with reference to quantities of gold or silver for various purposes, usually in amounts of 9, 19 or 95 mithqáls.  The equivalents of these in the metric system and in troy ounces (which are used in the measurement of precious metals), are as follows:<p>
	   9 mithqáls =  32.775 grammes  =  1.05374 troy ounces<br>
	   19 mithqáls =  69.192 grammes  =  2.22456 troy ounces<br>
	   95 mithqáls = 345.958 grammes  = 11.12282 troy ounces<p>
	   This computation is based on the guidance of Shoghi Effendi, conveyed in a letter written on his behalf, which states "one mithqál consists of nineteen nakhuds.  The weight of twenty-four nakhuds equals four and three-fifths grammes.  Calculations may be made on this basis."  The mithqál traditionally used in the Middle East had consisted of 24 nakhuds but in the Bayán this was changed to 19 nakhuds and Bahá'u'lláh confirmed this as the size of the mithqál referred to in the Bahá'i laws (Q&A 23).
