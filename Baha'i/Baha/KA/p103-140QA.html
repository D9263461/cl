		QUESTION:  <i>Should a man go on a journey without specifying a time for his return--without indicating, in other words, the expected period of his absence--and should no word be heard of him thereafter, and all trace <a name="p106"></a> of him be lost, what course should be followed by his wife?</i><p>
		ANSWER:  Should he have omitted to fix a time for his return despite being aware of the stipulation of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas in this regard, his wife should wait for one full year, after which she shall be free either to adopt the course that is praiseworthy, or to choose for herself another husband.  If, however, he be unaware of this stipulation, she should abide in patience until such time as God shall please to disclose to her his fate.  By the course that is praiseworthy in this connection is meant the exercise of patience.<p>

		QUESTION:  <i>Concerning the holy verse:  "When We heard the clamour of the children as yet unborn, We doubled their share and decreased those of the rest."</i><p>
		ANSWER:  According to the Book of God, the estate of the deceased is divided into 2,520 shares, which number is the lowest common multiple of all integers up to nine, and these shares are then distributed into seven portions, each of which is allocated, as mentioned in the Book, to a particular category of heirs.  The children, for example, are allotted nine blocks of 60 shares, comprising 540 shares in all.  The meaning of the statement "We doubled their share" is thus that the children receive a further nine blocks of 60 shares, entitling them to a total of 18 blocks all told.  The extra shares that they receive are deducted from the portions of the other categories <a name="p107"></a> of heirs, so that, although it is revealed, for instance, that the spouse is entitled to "eight parts comprising four hundred and eighty shares", which is the equivalent of eight blocks of 60 shares, now, by virtue of this rearrangement, one and a half blocks of shares, comprising 90 shares in all, have been subtracted from the spouse's portion and reallocated to the children, and similarly in the case of the others.  The result is that the total amount subtracted is equivalent to the nine extra blocks of shares allotted to the children.<p>

		QUESTION:  <i>Is it necessary that the brother, in order to qualify for his portion of the inheritance, be descended from both the father and the mother of the deceased, or is it sufficient merely that there be one parent in common?</i><p>
		ANSWER:  If the brother be descended from the father he shall receive his share of the inheritance in the prescribed measure recorded in the Book; but if he be descended from the mother, he shall receive only two thirds of his entitlement, the remaining third reverting to the House of Justice.  This ruling is also applicable to the sister.<p>

		QUESTION:  <i>Amongst the provisions concerning inheritance it hath been laid down that, should the deceased leave no offspring, their share of the estate is to revert to the House of Justice.  In the event of other categories of heirs, such as the father, mother, brother, sister and teacher being similarly absent, do their shares of the inheritance also revert to the House of Justice, or are they dealt with in some other fashion?</i><p>
		<a name="p108"></a>ANSWER:  The sacred verse sufficeth.  He saith, exalted be His Word:  "Should the deceased leave no offspring, their share shall revert to the House of Justice" etc. and "Should the deceased leave offspring, but none of the other categories of heirs that have been specified in the Book, they shall receive two thirds of the inheritance and the remaining third shall revert to the House of Justice" etc.  In other words, where there are no offspring, their allotted portion of the inheritance reverteth to the House of Justice; and where there are offspring but the other categories of heirs are lacking, two thirds of the inheritance pass to the offspring, the remaining third reverting to the House of Justice.  This ruling hath both general and specific application, which is to say that whenever any category of this latter class of heirs is absent, two thirds of their inheritance pass to the offspring and the remaining third to the House of Justice.<p>

		QUESTION:  <i>Concerning the basic sum on which Huqúqu'lláh is payable</i>.<p>
		ANSWER:  The basic sum on which Huqúqu'lláh is payable is nineteen mithqáls of gold.  In other words, when money to the value of this sum hath been acquired, a payment of Huqúq falleth due.  Likewise Huqúq is payable when the value, not the number, of other forms of property reacheth the prescribed amount.  Huqúqu'lláh is payable no more than once.  A person, for instance, who <a name="p109"></a> acquireth a thousand mithqáls of gold, and payeth the Huqúq, is not liable to make a further such payment on this sum, but only on what accrueth to it through commerce, business and the like.  When this increase, namely the profit realized, reacheth the prescribed sum, one must carry out what God hath decreed.  Only when the principal changeth hands is it once more subject to payment of Huqúq, as it was the first time.  The Primal Point hath directed that Huqúqu'lláh must be paid on the value of whatsoever one possesseth; yet, in this Most Mighty Dispensation, We have exempted the household furnishings, that is such furnishings as are needed, and the residence itself.<p>

		QUESTION:  <i>Which is to take precedence:  the Huqúqu'lláh, the debts of the deceased or the cost of the funeral and burial?</i><p>
		ANSWER:  The funeral and burial take precedence, then settlement of debts, then payment of Huqúqu'lláh.  Should the property of the deceased prove insufficient to cover his debts, the remainder of his estate should be distributed among these debts in proportion to their size.<p>

		<a name="p110"></a>QUESTION: <i>If intercourse take place between a couple during their year of patience, and they become estranged again thereafter, must they recommence their year of patience, or may the days preceding the intercourse be included in the reckoning of the year?  And once divorce hath taken place, is it necessary that a further period of waiting be observed?</i><p>
		ANSWER:  Should affection be renewed between the couple during their year of patience, the marriage tie is valid, and what is commanded in the Book of God must be observed; but once the year of patience hath been completed and that which is decreed by God taketh place, a further period of waiting is not required.  Sexual intercourse between husband and wife is forbidden during their year of patience, and whoso committeth this act must seek God's forgiveness, and, as a punishment, render to the House of Justice a fine of nineteen mithqáls of gold.<p>

		QUESTION:  <i>Should antipathy develop between a couple after the Marriage Verses have been read and the dowry paid, may divorce take place without observance of the year of patience?</i><p>

		QUESTION:  <i>What procedure should be followed on the discovery of lost property?</i><p>
		ANSWER:  If such property be found in the town, its discovery is to be announced once by the town crier.  If the owner of the property is then found, it should be delivered up to him.  Otherwise, the finder of the property should wait one year, and if, during this period, the owner cometh to light, the finder should receive from him the crier's fee and restore to him his property; only if the year should pass without the owner's being identified may the finder take possession of the property himself.  If the value of the property is less than or equal to the crier's fee, the finder should wait a single day from the time of its discovery, at the end of which, if the owner hath not come to light, he may himself appropriate it; and in the case of property discovered in an uninhabited area, the finder should observe a three days' wait, on the passing of which period, if the identity of the owner remain unknown, he is free to take possession of his find.<p>

		ANSWER:  The starting-point for computation is the day the couple part, and if, therefore, they have separated a year before the husband's departure, and if the fragrance of affection hath not been renewed between the couple, divorce may take place.  Otherwise the year must be counted from the day of his departure, and the conditions set forth in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas observed.<p>

		ANSWER:  This is solely for service such as is performed by any other class of servants, be they young or old, in exchange for wages; such a maiden is free to choose a husband at whatever time she pleaseth, for it is forbidden either that women should be purchased, or that a man should have more wives than two.<p>

		ANSWER:  If the teacher is not of the people of Bahá, he doth not inherit.  Should there be several teachers, the share is to be divided equally amongst them.  If the teacher is deceased, his offspring do not inherit his share, but rather two thirds of it revert to the children of the owner of the estate, and the remaining one third to the House of Justice.<p>

		QUESTION:  <i>Concerning disparities between certain revealed verses.</i><p>
		ANSWER:  Many Tablets were revealed and dispatched in their original form without being checked and reviewed.  Consequently, as bidden, they were again read out in the Holy Presence, and brought into conformity with the grammatical conventions of the people in order to forestall the cavils of opponents of the Cause.  Another reason for this practice is that the new style inaugurated by the Herald, may the souls of all else but Him be offered up for His sake, was seen to be marked by substantial latitude in adherence to the rules of <a name="p124"></a> grammar; sacred verses therefore were then revealed in a style which is for the most part in conformity with current usage for ease of understanding and concision of expression.<p>

To read one verse, or even one word, in a spirit of joy and radiance, is preferable to the perusal of many Books.<p>

		QUESTION:  <i>May a person, in drawing up his will, assign some portion of his property--beyond that which is devoted to payment of Huqúqu'lláh and the settlement of debts--to works of charity, or is he entitled to do no more than allocate a certain sum to cover funeral and burial expenses, so that the rest of his estate will be distributed in the manner fixed by God among the designated categories of heirs?</i><p>
		ANSWER:  A person hath full jurisdiction over his property.  If he is able to discharge the Huqúqu'lláh, and is free of debt, then all that is recorded in his will, and any declaration or avowal it containeth, shall be acceptable.  God, verily, hath permitted him to deal with that which He hath bestowed upon him in whatever manner he may desire.<p>

Should someone pledge himself, however, to offer up a fast to God, seeking in this way the fulfilment of a wish, or to realize some other aim, this is permissible, now as heretofore.  Howbeit, it is God's wish, exalted be His glory, that vows and pledges be directed to such objectives as will profit mankind.<p>

		<i>And in another Tablet, these exalted words have been revealed:</i>  O Muhammad!  The Ancient of Days hath turned His countenance towards thee, making mention of thee, and exhorting the people of God to educate their children.  Should a father neglect this most weighty commandment laid down in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas by the Pen of the Eternal King, he shall forfeit rights of fatherhood, and be accounted guilty before God.  Well is it with him who imprinteth on his heart the admonitions of the Lord, and steadfastly cleaveth unto them.  God, in truth, enjoineth on His servants what shall assist and profit them, and enable them to draw nigh unto Him.  He is the Ordainer, the Everlasting.<p>

		<a name="p139"></a>He is God, exalted be He, the Lord of majesty and power!  The Prophets and Chosen Ones have all been commissioned by the One True God, magnified be His glory, to nurture the trees of human existence with the living waters of uprightness and understanding, that there may appear from them that which God hath deposited within their inmost selves.  As may be readily observed, each tree yieldeth a certain fruit, and a barren tree is but fit for fire.  The purpose of these Educators, in all they said and taught, was to preserve man's exalted station.  Well is it with him who in the Day of God hath laid fast hold upon His precepts and hath not deviated from His true and fundamental Law.  The fruits that best befit the tree of human life are trustworthiness and godliness, truthfulness and sincerity; but greater than all, after recognition of the unity of God, praised and glorified be He, is regard for the rights that are due to one's parents.  This teaching hath been mentioned in all the Books of God, and reaffirmed by the Most Exalted Pen.  Consider that which the Merciful Lord hath revealed in the Qur'án, exalted are His words:  "Worship ye God, join with Him no peer or likeness; and show forth kindliness and charity towards your parents. . ."  Observe how loving-kindness to one's parents hath been linked to recognition of the one true God!  Happy they who are endued with true wisdom and understanding, who see and perceive, who read and understand, and who observe that which God hath <a name="p140"></a> revealed in the Holy Books of old, and in this incomparable and wondrous Tablet.<p>
