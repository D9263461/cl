	</center>
	A number of Tablets revealed by Bahá'u'lláh after the Kitáb-i-Aqdas contain passages supplementary to the provisions of the Most Holy Book.  The most noteworthy of these have been published in <i>Tablets of Bahá'u'lláh revealed after the Kitáb-i-Aqdas</i>.  Included in this section is an extract from the Tablet of Ishráqát.  The text of the three Obligatory Prayers referred to in Questions and Answers and the Prayer for the Dead mentioned in the Text are, likewise, reprinted here.

	O people of God!  That which traineth the world is Justice, for it is upheld by two pillars, reward and punishment.  These two pillars are the sources of life to the world.  Inasmuch as for each day there is a new problem and for every problem an expedient solution, such affairs should be referred to the House of Justice that the members thereof may act according to the needs and requirements of the time.  They that, for the sake of God, arise to serve His Cause, are the recipients of divine inspiration from the unseen Kingdom.  It is incumbent upon all to be obedient unto them.  All matters of State should be referred to the House of Justice, but acts of worship must be observed according to that which God hath revealed in His Book.

	O people of Bahá!  Ye are the dawning-places of the love of God and the daysprings of His loving-kindness.  Defile not your tongues with the cursing and reviling of any soul, and guard your eyes against that which is not seemly.  Set forth that which ye possess.  If it be favourably received, your end is attained; if not, to <a name="p92"></a>protest is vain.  Leave that soul to himself and turn unto the Lord, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.  Be not the cause of grief, much less of discord and strife.  The hope is cherished that ye may obtain true education in the shelter of the tree of His tender mercies and act in accordance with that which God desireth.  Ye are all the leaves of one tree and the drops of one ocean.
