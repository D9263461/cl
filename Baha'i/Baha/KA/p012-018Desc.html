	   <center><b>BY SHOGHI EFFENDI</b></center><p>
	   <center>TAKEN FROM <i>GOD PASSES BY</i>, HIS HISTORY<br>OF THE FIRST BAHÁ'Í CENTURY</center><p>
	   UNIQUE and stupendous as was this Proclamation, it proved to be but a prelude to a still mightier revelation of the creative power of its Author, and to what may well rank as the most signal act of His ministry--the promulgation of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas. Alluded to in the Kitáb-i-Íqán, the principal repository of that Law which the Prophet Isaiah had anticipated, and which the writer of the Apocalypse had described as the "<i>new heaven</i>" and the "<i>new earth</i>", as "<i>the Tabernacle of God</i>", as the "<i>Holy City</i>", as the "<i>Bride</i>", the "<i>New Jerusalem coming down from God</i>", this "<i>Most Holy Book</i>", whose provisions must remain inviolate for no less than a thousand years, and whose system will embrace the entire planet,  may well be regarded as the brightest emanation of the mind of Bahá'u'lláh, as the Mother Book of His Dispensation, and the Charter of His New World Order.<p>
	   Revealed soon after Bahá'u'lláh had been transferred to the <a href="../../Others/ROB/V3/p253-274Ch12.html#facingp274">house of `Udi Khammar</a> (circa 1873), at a time when He was still encompassed by the tribulations that had afflicted Him, through the acts committed by His enemies and the professed adherents of His Faith, this Book, this treasury enshrining the priceless gems of His Revelation, stands out, by virtue of the principles it inculcates, the administrative

	   institutions it ordains and the function with which it invests the  appointed  Successor  of  its  Author,  unique  and incomparable among the world's sacred Scriptures. For, unlike the Old Testament and the Holy Books which preceded it, in which the actual precepts uttered by the Prophet Himself are non-existent; unlike the Gospels, in which the few sayings attributed to Jesus Christ afford no clear guidance regarding the future administration of the affairs of His Faith; unlike even the Qur'án which, though explicit in the laws and ordinances formulated by the Apostle of God, is silent on the all-important subject of the succession, the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, <a href="../../Others/ROB/V3/Cover.html#cover5">revealed</a> from first to last by the Author of the Dispensation Himself, not only preserves for posterity the basic laws and ordinances on which the fabric of His future World Order must rest, but ordains, in addition to the function of interpretation which it confers upon His Successor, the necessary institutions through which the integrity and unity of His Faith can alone be safeguarded.<p>
	   In this Charter of the future world civilization its Author--at once the Judge, the Lawgiver, the Unifier and Redeemer of mankind--announces to the kings of the earth the promulgation of the "<i>Most Great Law</i>"; pronounces them to be His vassals; proclaims Himself the "<i>King of Kings</i>"; disclaims any intention of laying hands on their kingdoms; reserves for Himself the right to "<i>seize and possess the hearts of men</i>"; warns the world's ecclesiastical leaders not to weigh the "<i>Book of God</i>" with such standards as are current amongst them; and affirms that the Book itself is the "<i>Unerring Balance</i>" established amongst men. In it He formally ordains the institution of the "<i>House of Justice</i>", defines its functions, fixes its revenues, and designates its members as the "<i>Men of Justice</i>", the "<i>Deputies of God</i>", the "<i>Trustees of the All-Merciful</i>"; alludes to the future Centre of His  Covenant,  and  invests  Him  with  the  right  of interpreting His holy Writ; anticipates by implication the

	   In this Book He, moreover, prescribes the obligatory prayers; designates the time and period of fasting; prohibits congregational prayer except for the dead; fixes the Qiblih; institutes the Huqúqu'lláh (Right of God); formulates the law of inheritance; ordains the institution of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkár; establishes the Nineteen Day Feast, the Bahá'í festivals and the Intercalary Days; abolishes the institution of priesthood; prohibits slavery, asceticism, mendicancy, monasticism, penance, the use of pulpits and the kissing of hands; prescribes monogamy; condemns cruelty to animals, idleness and sloth,  backbiting and calumny; censures divorce; interdicts gambling, the use of opium, wine and other intoxicating drinks; specifies the punishments for murder, arson, adultery and theft; stresses the importance of marriage and lays down its essential conditions; imposes the obligation of engaging in some trade or profession, exalting such occupation to the rank of worship; emphasizes the necessity of providing the means for the education of children; and lays upon every person the duty of writing a testament and of strict obedience to one's government.<p>
	   Apart from these provisions Bahá'u'lláh exhorts His followers to consort, with amity and concord and without discrimination, with the adherents of all religions; warns them to guard against fanaticism, <span TITLE="Conduct or language inciting rebellion against the authority of a state.">sedition</span>, pride, dispute and contention; inculcates upon them immaculate cleanliness, strict truthfulness, spotless chastity, trustworthiness, hospitality,  fidelity,  courtesy,  forbearance,  justice and fairness; counsels them to be "<i>even as the fingers of one hand and the limbs of one body</i>"; calls upon them to arise and serve

	   His Cause; and assures them of His undoubted aid. He, furthermore, dwells upon the instability of human affairs; declares that true liberty consists in man's submission to His commandments; cautions them not to be indulgent in carrying out His statutes; prescribes the twin inseparable duties of recognizing the "<i>Dayspring of God's Revelation</i>" and of observing all the ordinances revealed by Him, neither of which, He affirms, is acceptable without the other.<p>
	   The significant summons issued to the Presidents of the Republics of the American continent to seize their opportunity in the Day of God and to champion the cause of justice; the injunction to the members of parliaments throughout the world, urging the adoption of a universal script and language; His warnings to William I, the conqueror of Napoleon III; the reproof He administers to Francis Joseph, the Emperor of Austria; His reference to "<i>the lamentations of Berlin</i>" in His apostrophe to "<i>the banks of the Rhine</i>";  His  condemnation  of "<i>the throne of tyranny</i>" established in Constantinople, and His prediction of the extinction of its "<i>outward splendour</i>" and of the tribulations destined to overtake its inhabitants; the words of cheer and comfort He addresses to His native city, assuring her that God had chosen her to be "<i>the source of the joy of all mankind</i>";  His prophecy that "<i>the voice of the heroes of Khurásán</i>" will be raised in glorification of their Lord; His assertion that men "<i>endued with mighty valour</i>" will be raised up in Kirmán who will make mention of Him; and finally, His magnanimous assurance to a perfidious brother who had afflicted Him with such anguish, that an "<i>ever-forgiving, all-bounteous</i>" God would forgive him his iniquities were he only to repent--all these further enrich the contents of a Book designated by its Author as "<i>the source of true felicity</i>", as the "<i>Unerring Balance</i>", as the "<i>Straight Path</i>" and as the "<i>quickener of mankind</i>".<p>

"<i>This Book</i>", He Himself testifies, "<i>is a heaven which We have adorned with the stars of Our commandments and prohibitions.</i>" "<i>Blessed the man</i>", He, moreover, has stated, "<i>who will read it, and ponder the verses sent down in it by God, the Lord of Power, the Almighty. Say, O men! Take hold of it with the hand of resignation . . . By My life! It hath been sent down in a manner that amazeth the minds of men. Verily, it is My weightiest testimony unto all people, and the proof of the All-Merciful unto all who are in heaven and all who are on earth.</i>" And again: "<i>Blessed the palate that savoureth its sweetness, and the perceiving eye that recognizeth that which is treasured therein, and the understanding heart that comprehendeth its allusions and mysteries. By God! Such is the majesty of what hath been revealed therein, and so tremendous the revelation of its veiled allusions that the loins of utterance shake when attempting their description.</i>" And finally: "<i>In such a manner hath the Kitáb-i-Aqdas been revealed that it attracteth and embraceth all the divinely appointed Dispensations. Blessed those who peruse it! Blessed those who apprehend it! Blessed those who meditate upon it! Blessed those who ponder its meaning! So vast is its range that it hath encompassed all men ere their recognition of it. Erelong will its sovereign power, its pervasive influence and the greatness of its might be manifested on earth.</i>"
