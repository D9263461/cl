Attempting to fill this void with material possessions, success, relationships, or pleasure is often compared to drinking saltwater--it only intensifies the thirst. God is the universal source of ''living water''. God's provision for spiritual fulfillment is offered to everyone.

'Abdu'l-Bahá in a Tablet explains this arresting image: ''As to your question about the meaning of the Arabic Hidden Words: 'Couldst thou but see with Mine eye', when man reacheth the station of selflessness, and his love of self is entirely wiped out, his existence becometh like unto non-existence, and a ray from God's presence sheddeth its light upon him.

One possible explanation: Thirst is a common religous metaphor for a soul's deep longing for a divine connection, while quenching that thirst refers to finding satisfaction through faith in God.

Many religious traditions describe this unfulfilled longing as a ''God-shaped hole'' in the human heart that can only be filled by God. Attempting to fill this void with material possessions, success, relationships, or pleasure is often compared to drinking saltwater--it only intensifies the thirst. God is the universal source of ''living water''. God's provision for spiritual fulfillment is offered to everyone. ''If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink'' (John 7:37) is a universal invitation to all men, regardless of their background or past.

	Consider how with this one verse which hath descended from the <a class="hh" title="Heaven (paradise) and Hell are the highest and lowest conditions a human soul can experience. In the Bahá'í Writings these terms are used in a spiritual rather than a literal, material sense. These conditions of 'heaven' and 'hell' are not limited to life after death. 'Heaven' or 'paradise' is the state of perfection and spiritual state of nearness to God, achieved by a soul who has striven to acquire virtues during its life on earth, while 'hell' is the condition of imperfection, remoteness and the awareness of the deprivation one has brought by one's actions.

Thus God turneth iniquity into righteousness, were ye to explore the realms of divine <a class="hh" title="'' 'Knowledge is a light which God casteth into the heart of whomsoever He willeth.'

Human learning can act as a terrible veil blinding the soul to its purpose in life and its ultimate destiny...While Bahá'u'lláh extols the study of sciences and arts, He directs man to 'such sciences as are useful and would redound to the progress and advancement of the people'...'Abdu'l-Bahá emphasizes this truth as follows: ''...If, then, the pursuit of knowledge lead to the beauty of Him Who is the Object of all Knowledge, how excellent that goal; but if not, a mere drop will perhaps shut a man off from flooding grace, for with learning cometh arrogance and pride, and it bringeth on error and indifference to God...''" href="../../../CLUG/UnifiedGlossary.html#Knowledge">knowledge</a>, and fathom the mysteries of His <a class="hh" title="Knowledge; the ability to discern inner qualities and relationships, insight; good judgement.

'Heaven' or 'paradise' is the state of perfection and spiritual state of nearness to God, achieved by a soul who has striven to acquire virtues during its life on earth, while 'hell' is the condition of imperfection, remoteness and the awareness of the deprivation one has brought by one's actions.

Attempting to fill this void with material possessions, success, relationships, or pleasure is often compared to drinking saltwater--it only intensifies the thirst. God is the universal source of ''living water''. God's provision for spiritual fulfillment is offered to everyone.

One possible explanation: Thirst is a common religous metaphor for a soul's deep longing for a divine connection, while quenching that thirst refers to finding satisfaction through faith in God. The metaphor addresses a fundamental reality of the human condition: a spiritual void that worldly things can never fully satisfy. Many religious traditions describe this unfulfilled longing as a ''God-shaped hole'' in the human heart that can only be filled by God. Attempting to fill this void with material possessions, success, relationships, or pleasure is often compared to drinking saltwater--it only intensifies the thirst. God is the universal source of ''living water''. God's provision for spiritual fulfillment is offered to everyone.
