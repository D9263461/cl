In the Bahá'í Writings these terms are used in a spiritual rather than a literal, material sense. These conditions of 'heaven' and 'hell' are not limited to life after death. 'Heaven' or 'paradise' is the state of perfection and spiritual state of nearness to God, achieved by a soul who has striven to acquire virtues during its life on earth, while 'hell' is the condition of imperfection, remoteness and the awareness of the deprivation one has brought by one's actions.

With regard to the operation of this principle in His own Day, Bahá'u'lláh affirms: If all who are in heaven and on earth be invested in this day with the powers and attributes destined for the Letters of the Bayán, whose station is ten thousand times more glorious than that of the Letters of the Qur'anic Dispensation, and if they one and all should, swift as the twinkling of an eye, hesitate to recognize My Revelation, they shall be accounted, in the sight of God, of those that have gone astray, and regarded as 'Letters of Negation.'" href="../../../CLUG/UnifiedGlossary.html#LettersofNegation">negation</a> and falsehood, perchance you may cause the <a class="hh" title="The Bahá'í writings are replete with examples likening the soul of man to a bird.

The metaphor addresses a fundamental reality of the human condition: a spiritual void that worldly things can never fully satisfy. Many religious traditions describe this unfulfilled longing as a ''God-shaped hole'' in the human heart that can only be filled by God. Attempting to fill this void with material possessions, success, relationships, or pleasure is often compared to drinking saltwater--it only intensifies the thirst. God is the universal source of ''living water''. God's provision for spiritual fulfillment is offered to everyone. ''If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink'' (John 7:37) is a universal invitation to all men, regardless of their background or past.

Shoghi Effendi elaborates on this theme, stating: ''Then, and only then, will the vast, the majestic process, set in motion at the dawn of the Adamic cycle, attain its consummation--a process which commenced six thousand years ago, with the planting, in the soil of the divine will, of the tree of divine revelation...The first part of this process was the slow and steady growth of this tree...as a direct consequence of the light and warmth imparted to it by a series of progressive dispensations...The second part...was the fruition of this tree, 'that belongeth neither to the East nor to the West', when the Báb appeared as the perfect fruit and declared His mission in the Year Sixty in the city of Shíráz.''" href="../../../CLUG/UnifiedGlossary.html#Revelation,TreeofDivine">tree of divine knowledge</a>.

The second form of Covenant is such as the one Bahá'u'lláh made with His people that they should accept the Master. This is merely to establish and strengthen the succession of the series of Lights that appear after every Manifestation.

In like manner, if it be said that all the days are but one and the same, it is correct and true.

It is one of man's purposes in this life to acquire and refine these attributes and virtues.

Of these truths we are certain, and such assurance is properly called certitude.

Attempting to fill this void with material possessions, success, relationships, or pleasure is often compared to drinking saltwater--it only intensifies the thirst.

In the Bahá'í Writings these terms are used in a spiritual rather than a literal, material sense. These conditions of 'heaven' and 'hell' are not limited to life after death. 'Heaven' or 'paradise' is the state of perfection and spiritual state of nearness to God, achieved by a soul who has striven to acquire virtues during its life on earth, while 'hell' is the condition of imperfection, remoteness and the awareness of the deprivation one has brought by one's actions. Bahá'u'lláh explains in the Kitáb-i-Íqán that the use of the word 'heaven' in earlier prophecies such as the 'cleaving asunder of the heaven' is metaphorical not literal" href="../../../CLUG/UnifiedGlossary.html#HeavenandHell">heaven</a>" hath been applied to many and divers things; such as the "heaven of <a class="hh" title="Commandments of God revealed by the Manifestations.

Human learning can act as a terrible veil blinding the soul to its purpose in life and its ultimate destiny...While Bahá'u'lláh extols the study of sciences and arts, He directs man to 'such sciences as are useful and would redound to the progress and advancement of the people'...'Abdu'l-Bahá emphasizes this truth as follows: ''...If, then, the pursuit of knowledge lead to the beauty of Him Who is the Object of all Knowledge, how excellent that goal; but if not, a mere drop will perhaps shut a man off from flooding grace, for with learning cometh arrogance and pride, and it bringeth on error and indifference to God...''" href="../../../CLUG/UnifiedGlossary.html#Knowledge">Knowledge</a>," the "heaven of <a class="hh" title="A deep, unwavering conviction and assurance in one's faith, such that it excludes all doubt.

Of these truths we are certain, and such assurance is properly called certitude. Certitude differs from opinion; for opinion is assurance of the probability of a proposition, and therefore opinion is always accompanied by the consciousness that further evidence may cause a change of mind in favour of the opposite opinion.

The metaphor addresses a fundamental reality of the human condition: a spiritual void that worldly things can never fully satisfy. Many religious traditions describe this unfulfilled longing as a ''God-shaped hole'' in the human heart that can only be filled by God. Attempting to fill this void with material possessions, success, relationships, or pleasure is often compared to drinking saltwater--it only intensifies the thirst. God is the universal source of ''living water''. God's provision for spiritual fulfillment is offered to everyone. ''If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink'' (John 7:37) is a universal invitation to all men, regardless of their background or past.
