        </blockquote>
        And again, revealing another aspect of such divine unity, He states:

The path to true fulfillment lies in recognizing that all knowledge, might, power and creation ultimately originate from God, and not inherent in man. The Qur'an states that humans have no knowledge ''except what He has taught us'', and God is frequently described as Al-Alim (The All-Knowing).  Seeking knowledge is a religious obligation to understand God's signs in the universe and draw closer to Him. This is emphasized by the first word revealed in the Qur'an: ''Iqra'' (read/recite), which also states that only those with knowledge truly fear God (35:28), implying that true understanding leads to profound reverence. Knowledge isn't just intellectual; it's about wisdom, spiritual growth, and applying learning for good, as commanded by Allah." href="../../../CLUG/UnifiedGlossary.html#KnowledgeKnowable">unknowable</a> Essence as one and the same. By this is meant that whatever pertaineth to the former, all His acts and doings, whatever He ordaineth or forbiddeth, should be considered, in all their aspects, and under all circumstances, and without any reservation, as identical with the Will of God Himself.

        </blockquote>
        This point is further reinforced in one of the <a class="hh" title="Quiet reflection, especially on a passage of Sacred Scripture.

            With regard to your question concerning the Virgin Birth of <a class="hh" title="Founder of the religion of Christianity and accepted by Bahá'ís as a Manifestation of God. Bahá'ís believe that Jesus' promise to return 'in the glory of the Father' was fulfilled by the coming of Bahá'u'lláh. As in the Qur'án, in the Bahá'í Writings Jesus is often referred to as 'the Spirit of God' and 'the Son'" href="../../../CLUG/UnifiedGlossary.html#Jesus">Jesus</a>; on this point, as on several others, the Bahá'í teachings are in full agreement with the doctrines of the Catholic Church. In the Kitáb-i-Íqán (Book of Certitude) <a href="p001-094.html#parb59">page 56</a>, and in a few other <a class="hh" title="A sacred epistle containing a revelation" href="../../../CLUG/UnifiedGlossary.html#Tablet">Tablets</a> still unpublished, <a class="hh" title="Bahá'u'lláh (The Glory of God), founder of the Bahá'í Faith, ''The Supreme Manifestation of God and the Dayspring of His Most Divine Essence.''

Born Tihrán, Persia, Nov. 12, 1817*; ascended Bahjí, Palestine, now Israel, May 29, 1892" href="../../../CLUG/UnifiedGlossary.html#Bahá'u'lláh">Bahá'u'lláh</a> confirms, however indirectly, the Catholic conception of the Virgin Birth. Also <a class="hh" title="The 'Servant of Bahá', the eldest son and appointed Successor of Bahá'u'lláh, and the Centre of His Covenant (1844-1921)" href="../../../CLUG/UnifiedGlossary.html#'Abdu'l-Bahá">'Abdu'l-Bahá</a> in '<a class="hh" title="A volume first published in 1908 comprising questions posed to 'Abdu'l-Bahá by Laura Clifford Barney during several visits to 'Akká in 1904–6, along with 'Abdu'l-Bahá's answers and explanations" href="../../../CLUG/UnifiedGlossary.html#SomeAnsweredQuestions">Some Answered Questions</a>', Chap. 12, <a href="../../AB/SAQ/p001-080Part1.html#para198">page 62</a>, explicitly states that Christ found existence through the <a class="hh" title="According to the Bahá'í teachings, Gabriel, the 'Dove' and the 'Maid of Heaven' are symbols of the divine Reality of the Manifestation Himself. 'Abdu'l-Bahá states clearly that the independent Prophets receive the bounty of divinity without any 'intermediary'. In the Writings of Bahá'u'lláh, He has used the 'Maid of Heaven' to refer to Himself or to one of the attributes of God, and sometimes as the personification of the 'Most Great Spirit', signifying thereby the Revelation of God in its fullness." href="../../../CLUG/UnifiedGlossary.html#MaidenofHeaven">spirit of God</a> which statement necessarily implies, when reviewed in the light of the text, that Jesus was not the son of Joseph. <sup>172</sup><p>
            First regarding the birth of Jesus Christ. In the light of what Bahá'u'lláh and 'Abdu'l-Bahá have stated concerning this subject it is evident that Jesus came into this world through the direct intervention of the <a class="hh" title="[Know that, speaking generally, there are five divisions of the spirit...] The fifth spirit is the Holy Spirit... the mediator between God and His creatures. It is like a mirror facing the sun...Every time it appears, the world is renewed, and a new cycle is founded...Whenever it appears, it renews the world of humanity...it arrays the world of existence in a praiseworthy garment, dispels the darkness of ignorance, and causes the radiation of the light of perfections...the appearance of Bahá'u'lláh was like a new springtime which appeared with holy breezes...It established the Throne of the Divine Kingdom in the center of the world and, by the power of the Holy Spirit, revived souls and established a new cycle. " href="../../../CLUG/UnifiedGlossary.html#Spirit,FifthDegreeof">Holy Spirit</a>, and that consequently His birth was quite <a class="hh" title="Occurrences and events for which there is no apparent scientific explanation and which may indicate the intervention of God. Bahá'ís do not deny the possibility of miracles occurring but believe that they are valuable proofs of the Manifestation of God only for those who witness them. What is more important is the inner significance of the miracle, its spiritual meaning" href="../../../CLUG/UnifiedGlossary.html#Miracles">miraculous</a>. This is an established fact, and the friends need not feel at all surprised, as the belief in the possibility of miracles has never been rejected in the Teachings. Their importance, however, has been minimized. <sup>173</sup><p>
            What science calls a virgin birth we do not associate with that of Jesus Christ, which we believe to have been a miracle and a sign of His Prophethood. In this matter we are in entire agreement with the most orthodox church views. <sup>174</sup><p>
            It would be sacrilege for a Bahá'í to believe that the parents of Jesus were illegally married and that the latter was consequently of an illegal union. Such a possibility cannot be even conceived by a <a class="hh" title="Term commonly used by Bahá'ís to refer to themselves." href="../../../CLUG/UnifiedGlossary.html#Believers">believer</a> who recognizes the high station of Mary and the Divine Prophethood of Jesus Christ. It is this same false accusation which the people of His Day attributed to Mary that Bahá'u'lláh indirectly <a class="hh" title="Refusing to accept a religious or philosophical doctrine; Refusing to accept, acknowledge, or fulfill an obligation or duty." href="../../../CLUG/UnifiedGlossary.html#Repudiation">repudiated</a> in the ĺqán. The only alternative therefore is to admit that the birth of Jesus has been miraculous. The operation of miracles is not necessarily irrational or illogical. It does by no means constitute a limitation of the Omnipotence of <a class="hh" title="The deity. Bahá'ís believe there is only one God, unknowable in His essence, who is the creator and absolute ruler of the universe" href="../../../CLUG/UnifiedGlossary.html#God">God</a>. The belief in the possibilities of miracles, on the contrary, implies that God's power is beyond any limitation whatsoever. For it is only logical to believe that the <a class="hh" title="The deity. Bahá'ís believe there is only one God, unknowable in His essence, who is the creator and absolute ruler of the universe" href="../../../CLUG/UnifiedGlossary.html#God">Creator</a>, Who is the sole Author of all the laws operating in the universe, is above them and can, therefore, if He deems it necessary, alter them at His Own Will. We, as <a class="hh" title="[Know that, speaking generally, there are five divisions of the spirit...] The human spirit may be likened to the bounty of the sun shining on a mirror. The body of man...grows and develops through the animal spirit. This perfected body can be compared to a mirror, and the human spirit to the sun. Nevertheless...if the mirror is destroyed or ceases to exist, no harm will happen to the bounty of the sun, which is everlasting. This spirit has the power of discovery...All these wonderful signs, these scientific discoveries, great enterprises and important historical events which you know are due to it. From the realm of the invisible and hidden, through spiritual power, it brought them to the plane of the visible. So man is upon the earth, yet he makes discoveries in the heavens...But the spirit of man has two aspects: one divine, one satanic...If it acquires virtues, it is the most noble of the existing beings; and if it acquires vices, it becomes the most degraded existence" href="../../../CLUG/UnifiedGlossary.html#Spirit,ThirdDegreeof">humans</a>, cannot possibly attempt to read His Mind, and to fully grasp His <a class="hh" title="Knowledge; the ability to discern inner qualities and relationships, insight; good judgement. Bahá'u'lláh writes: 'Above all else, the greatest gift and the most wondrous blessing hath ever been and will continue to be wisdom'" href="../../../CLUG/UnifiedGlossary.html#Wisdom">Wisdom</a>. Mystery is therefore an inseparable part of true <a class="hh" title="Religion has two main purposes: the personal spiritual development of the individual and to establish order in the world. Bahá'u'lláh writes, 'Religion is verily the chief instrument for the establishment of order in the world and of tranquillity amongst its peoples.' 'Should the lamp of religion be obscured, chaos and confusion will ensue, and the lights of fairness and justice, of tranquillity and peace cease to shine.'" href="../../../CLUG/UnifiedGlossary.html#Religion">religion</a>, and as such, should be recognized by the believers. <sup>175</sup><p>
            Again with regard to your question relative to the birth of Jesus; he wishes me to inform you that there is nothing further he can add to the explanation he gave you in his previous communication regarding this point. One thing, however, he wishes again to bring to your attention, namely that miracles are always possible, even though they do not constitute a regular channel whereby God reveals His power to mankind. To reject miracles on the ground that they imply a breach of the laws of nature is a very shallow, well-nigh a stupid argument, inasmuch as God Who is the Author of the universe can, in His Wisdom and Omnipotence, bring any change, no matter how temporary, in the operation of the laws which He Himself has created.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Teachings do not tell us of any miraculous birth besides that of Jesus. <sup>176</sup><p>
            <a class="hh" title="Sir, though generally used to mean 'master'. Áqá was the title given specifically to 'Abdu'l-Bahá by Bahá'u'lláh, in which context it is rendered into English as 'the Master'. In modern usage, when affixed to a surname it means 'Mister'." href="../../../CLUG/UnifiedGlossary.html#Áqá">The Master</a> clearly writes in a Tablet that Christ was <i>not</i> begotten in the ordinary way, but by the Holy Spirit. So we must accept this. Every Faith has some miracles, and this is the great miracle of the Christian Faith. But we must not let it be a test to us. Our human <a class="hh" title="That which in the individual feels, thinks, perceives, wills and reasons. 'Abdu'l-Bahá has said that the 'human spirit which distinguishes man from the animal is the rational soul; and these two names--the human spirit and the rational soul--designate one thing...the mind is the power of the human spirit. Spirit is the lamp; mind is the light which shines from the lamp. Spirit is the tree, and mind is the fruit. Mind is the perfection of the spirit, and its essential quality, as the sun's rays are the essential necessity of the sun.'" href="../../../CLUG/UnifiedGlossary.html#Mind">minds</a> are so small, and as yet so immature compared to the men of the future, that we should have no difficulty in acknowledging the Power of God when He chooses to show it in some manner 'illogical' to us! <sup>177</sup>

        Accounts of Nimrod's dream have been related in various books, including Qisasu'l-Anbíyá of Abú-Isháq Níshábúrí which states:
        <blockquote>
            Nimrod was told by the priests that in the coming two or three years a child will be separated from his mother and your sovereignty will be demolished by him. Nimrod ordered to kill every child who became separated from his mother. This order was carried out for three years.
        </blockquote>
        It has been related that Nimrod had a terrible dream. He asked the wise men its interpretation. In interpreting it, one of them announced to him the advent of Abraham. Some of the ancient accounts are contradictory in reporting this dream; one of them says that Nimrod's personal astrologer, Azar, dreamed the dream of his coming destruction. Majlisí relates in volume 14 of the <a class="hh" title="Literally, 'Seas of Lights'; an important 14 volume compilation by Muhammad Báqiru'l-Majlisí at the close of the 16th century AD which systematized Shia traditions, including many from al-Kafi, focusing on esoteric meanings and spiritual wisdom.

One night Azar understood from the arrangement of the stars that a boy would appear in that land who would destroy Nimrod and his followers. In the morning he informed Nimrod about this matter and said to him that very soon the seed of this boy will be fixed in the womb of his mother. Nimrod was astonished and asked whether the boy was already in the womb of the mother. Azar answered that it was not yet, and that Nimrod could order that men not cohabit with their women. And so it was that no woman was allowed to be with husband.<p>
        But Azar himself slept with his wife and they themselves conceived Abraham. Azar, from the position of the stars, knew that they would burn his son but he did not know that God would save him.

'Heaven' or 'paradise' is the state of perfection and spiritual state of nearness to God, achieved by a soul who has striven to acquire virtues during its life on earth, while 'hell' is the condition of imperfection, remoteness and the awareness of the deprivation one has brought by one's actions.

To cite but one instance:
        <blockquote>
            O people of the Bayán! We have chosen you out of the world to know and recognize Our Self. We have caused you to draw nigh unto the right side of <a class="hh" title="Heaven (paradise) and Hell are the highest and lowest conditions a human soul can experience. In the Bahá'í Writings these terms are used in a spiritual rather than a literal, material sense. These conditions of 'heaven' and 'hell' are not limited to life after death. 'Heaven' or 'paradise' is the state of perfection and spiritual state of nearness to God, achieved by a soul who has striven to acquire virtues during its life on earth, while 'hell' is the condition of imperfection, remoteness and the awareness of the deprivation one has brought by one's actions. Bahá'u'lláh explains in the Kitáb-i-Íqán that the use of the word 'heaven' in earlier prophecies such as the 'cleaving asunder of the heaven' is metaphorical not literal" href="../../../CLUG/UnifiedGlossary.html#HeavenandHell">Paradise</a>--the Spot out of which the undying Fire crieth in manifold accents: 'There is none other <a class="hh" title="The deity. Bahá'ís believe there is only one God, unknowable in His essence, who is the creator and absolute ruler of the universe" href="../../../CLUG/UnifiedGlossary.html#God">God</a> besides Me, the All-Powerful, the Most High!' Take heed lest ye allow your<a class="hh" title="In the Bahá'í Writings, the terms 'Satan' and 'satanic' are used metaphorically to refer to the lower, base, selfish side of human beings, in contrast to their higher, virtuous, selfless side. ''Regarding the statement...that man must renounce his own self, the meaning is that he must renounce his inordinate desires, his selfish purposes and the promptings of his human self, and seek out the holy breathings of the spirit, and follow the yearnings of his higher self, and immerse himself in the sea of sacrifice, with his heart fixed upon the beauty of the All-Glorious.''" href="../../../CLUG/UnifiedGlossary.html#Satan">selves</a> to be shut out as by a <a class="hh" title="In general this term refers to those obstacles which prevent people from recognizing the truth of the Manifestations of God: Misunderstood terms and allusions in scripture; divines and doctors that reject the new Manifestations." href="../../../CLUG/UnifiedGlossary.html#Veil">veil</a> from this <a class="hh" title="The sun.

Purge your <a class="hh" title="Throughout the Bahá'í writings reference is made to two ways of seeing, to the 'inner and outer eyes'. This inner vision, or inspired insight...must be cleansed of earthly things and directed towards that true knowledge shining from the Word of God. The possibility of man seeing with the eye of God is affirmed in a number of passages in Bahá'u'lláh's writings. 'Abdu'l-Bahá in a Tablet explains this arresting image: ''As to your question about the meaning of the Arabic Hidden Words: 'Couldst thou but see with Mine eye', when man reacheth the station of selflessness, and his love of self is entirely wiped out, his existence becometh like unto non-existence, and a ray from God's presence sheddeth its light upon him. Then he can see with the eye of God, and can hear with His ear. This is like iron in the fire. The qualities of the iron, its coldness, darkness and hardness are concealed, and it manifests heat, luminosity and fluidity, which are the qualities of the fire.''" href="../../../CLUG/UnifiedGlossary.html#EyeofThineHeart">sight</a>, that ye may perceive its glory with your own eyes, and depend not on the sight of any one except your self, for God hath never burdened any <a class="hh" title="The inner and essential reality of man which is not composed of physical matter and thus continues to exist after death" href="../../../CLUG/UnifiedGlossary.html#Soul">soul</a> beyond its power. Thus hath it been sent down unto the <a class="hh" title="The independent Prophets, or Manifestations, who are the, as 'Abdu'l-Bahá wrote: 'lawgivers and the founders of a new cycle...They are like the sun which is luminous in itself; the light is its essential necessity; it does not receive light from any other star.' They are also termed 'Prophets endowed with constancy'" href="../../../CLUG/UnifiedGlossary.html#Prophets,Greater">Prophets</a> and <a class="hh" title="Prophet of God.

        </blockquote>

Bahá'ís believe that this is a reference to Bahá'u'lláh.

        <blockquote>
            Imám Husayn has, as attested by the ĺqán, been endowed with special grace and power among the Imáms, hence the mystical reference to Bahá'u'lláh as the return of Imám Husayn, meaning the <a class="hh" title="[The Third of The Three Stages of Divine Revelation] The Unveiling by God of the laws, teachings or message transmitted through His Manifestations to mankind which hitherto He had hidden from them.

God reveals Himself through His attributes. Further, each created thing has been made the bearer of one of the signs or attributes of God, 'so that the whole of creation mirrors forth the beauty of God.' Human beings alone among creation have been made the bearers of all the divine attributes, and therefore may be said to be made in the 'image' of God. It is one of man's purposes in this life to acquire and refine these attributes and virtues. However, the chief locus of divine attributes in this world are the Manifestations of God who exemplify most perfectly all God's attributes. Many Bahá'í prayers end with a list of some of the attributes, or names, of God." href="../../../CLUG/UnifiedGlossary.html#AttributesofGod">attributes</a> with which Imám Husayn had been specifically endowed. <sup>254</sup><p>
            In the <a class="hh" title="Supplication to, or communion with, God. Bahá'ís are enjoined by Bahá'u'lláh to pray every morning and evening.

They are also termed 'Prophets endowed with constancy'" href="../../../CLUG/UnifiedGlossary.html#Prophets,Greater">Prophet</a>, but his position was very unique, and we know Bahá'u'lláh claims to be the 'return' of the Imám Husayn. He, in other words, identifies His Spirit with these Holy Souls gone before, that does not, of course, make Him in any way their reincarnation. Nor does it mean all of them were Prophets. <sup>256</sup>

            The fighting appears to have been of a sporadic nature consisting of single combat and brief forays. The steady fire maintained by the Umayyad archers on Husayn's camp took its own toll.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Umayyad army looted the tents, decapitated the bodies of all Husayn's companions and raised these on spears to lead their procession back to Kúfa.

The body of man...grows and develops through the animal spirit. This perfected body can be compared to a mirror, and the human spirit to the sun. Nevertheless...if the mirror is destroyed or ceases to exist, no harm will happen to the bounty of the sun, which is everlasting. This spirit has the power of discovery...All these wonderful signs, these scientific discoveries, great enterprises and important historical events which you know are due to it. From the realm of the invisible and hidden, through spiritual power, it brought them to the plane of the visible. So man is upon the earth, yet he makes discoveries in the heavens...But the spirit of man has two aspects: one divine, one satanic...If it acquires virtues, it is the most noble of the existing beings; and if it acquires vices, it becomes the most degraded existence" href="../../../CLUG/UnifiedGlossary.html#Spirit,ThirdDegreeof">mankind</a> is still immature.

Human learning can act as a terrible veil blinding the soul to its purpose in life and its ultimate destiny...While Bahá'u'lláh extols the study of sciences and arts, He directs man to 'such sciences as are useful and would redound to the progress and advancement of the people'...'Abdu'l-Bahá emphasizes this truth as follows: ''...If, then, the pursuit of knowledge lead to the beauty of Him Who is the Object of all Knowledge, how excellent that goal; but if not, a mere drop will perhaps shut a man off from flooding grace, for with learning cometh arrogance and pride, and it bringeth on error and indifference to God...''" href="../../../CLUG/UnifiedGlossary.html#Knowledge">knowledge</a> that all who dwell on earth and in heaven would have found themselves, by virtue of the grace streaming from Our <a class="hh" title="The power of the Holy Spirit manifested through Bahá'u'lláh's writings" href="../../../CLUG/UnifiedGlossary.html#AbháPen">pen</a>, completely independent of all knowledge save the knowledge of <a class="hh" title="The deity.
