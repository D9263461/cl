The second form of Covenant is such as the one Bahá'u'lláh made with His people that they should accept the Master. This is merely to establish and strengthen the succession of the series of Lights that appear after every Manifestation.

Detachment does not mean renunciation of the world, mendicancy or asceticism. Possession of earthly goods, pride in one's accomplishments, knowledge, position or own self can be a barrier between oneself and God. Ridding oneself of these is also detachment. ''As to the reference...that the human being must become detached from self...the meaning is that he should not seek out anything whatever for his own self in this swiftly passing life, but that he should cut the self away, that is, he should yield up the self and all its concerns on the field of martyrdom, at the time of the coming of the Lord.''" href="../../CLUG/UnifiedGlossary.html#Detachment">detachment</a> been wafted from the meadows of your hearts.

''As to the reference...that the human being must become detached from self...the meaning is that he should not seek out anything whatever for his own self in this swiftly passing life, but that he should cut the self away, that is, he should yield up the self and all its concerns on the field of martyrdom, at the time of the coming of the Lord.''" href="../../CLUG/UnifiedGlossary.html#Detachment">detachment</a> will reveal.

In the Bahá'í Writings these terms are used in a spiritual rather than a literal, material sense. These conditions of 'heaven' and 'hell' are not limited to life after death. 'Heaven' is the state of perfection and nearness to God, achieved by a soul who has striven to acquire virtues during its life on earth, while 'hell' is the condition of imperfection, remoteness and the awareness of the deprivation one has brought by one's actions. Bahá'u'lláh explains in the Kitáb-i-Íqán that the use of the word 'heaven' in earlier prophecies such as the 'cleaving asunder of the heaven' is metaphorical not literal" href="../../CLUG/UnifiedGlossary.html#HeavenandHell">heaven</a> and on earth.
