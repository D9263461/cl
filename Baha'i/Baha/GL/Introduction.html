	Key sentences may give us a first hint of the spirit of the book. "Let your vision be world-embracing, rather than confined to your own self." "All men have been created to carry forward an ever-advancing civilization." "That one indeed is a man who, today, dedicateth himself to the service of the entire human race."

	The religion with the universal aims suggested by these sentences had its origin in Persia in the last century. Bahá'u'lláh was born in 1817 and died in 1892. He was the son of a Persian nobleman and born to wealth and luxury. Yet the major part of His life was spent in imprisonment and exile. He knew intimately torture and the dungeon, scorn and hunger, poverty and betrayal. The story of His life and of the Faith which bears His name (for Bahá'í means "a follower of Bahá) is intensely dramatic and, until recent years, was little known in the west.

	About the first half of the nineteenth century, many Christians were stirred by the hope of the return of Christ. This expectancy, latent in the teachings of the New Testament, found its most vivid expression in the Millerites but it by no means was limited to humble Christians nor was it limited to America. Europe too <a name="pvi"></a>was stirred by this phenomenon. A group of German Templars left their native land and settled permanently at the foot of Mount Carmel, to await their Lord.

	What most Westerners do not understand at all, is that at the same time a wave of expectancy swept through Islám. Emerson would have understood this, but few other Americans were prepared at the time to consider any other world faith with even a modicum of sympathy. Yet the fact remains that in Islám some students and theologians felt that Islamic prophecies indicated an end of the laws of the Qur'án and a beginning of a new spiritual age. The thinking of these theologians was that the "Lord of the Age", to use the Islamic phrase, would appear.

	In 1844 a young merchant of Shíráz named Siyyid 'Alí Muhammad suddenly began to teach a new faith in Persia. He assumed the title of the Báb, which literally means "the Gate." The force of the Báb 's character and utterance was like a bombshell in that backward, priest-ridden land. Pleasant academic discussions as to the meaning of the traditions of Islám were at an end. A flame of interest in the Báb and devoted acceptance of Him swept the country. The astonished priests reacted with orthodox fury. They arrested and imprisoned the Báb and instigated systematic massacres of His followers.

	The Báb taught that a new spiritual era was at hand. He criticized vehemently the hypocrisy and intellectual dishonesty of the Muslim clergy. He urged the highest standard of character. And He promised that within nineteen years "Him Whom God would make manifest" would begin to teach and bring to men the basic laws and principles for a new age. The degenerate <a name="vii"></a> clergy, long corrupted by their powerful position in the church-state of Persia, feared and hated the movement initiated by the Báb. It was as if a strong, clean wind had suddenly swept through the dank atmosphere of a room long closed. The massacres of the Bábís find their parallel in the bloody holidays of ancient Rome. Hypocrisy and tyranny tried to destroy faith by the sword. The Báb was soon arrested and imprisoned in a remote mountain village. On July 9, 1850 hatred found its climax when the Báb was publicly martyred in the barracks square of the city of Tabríz. An attempt was made to completely exterminate the new faith in Persia. Bloody scenes multiplied throughout the country, and the surviving faithful went underground.

	The consternation of the priesthood during these years had been deepened by the fact that many of their own outstanding members had accepted the teachings of the Báb. Also outstanding men in other walks of life had accepted Him. Among these was Mírzá  Husayn 'Alí, a young man of eminent and wealthy family. Ignoring the jibes of family and class, Mírzá  Husayn 'Alí, Who is known to history as Bahá'u'lláh ("the Glory of God"), publicly championed the Báb. In the nation-wide campaign to exterminate the faith, Bahá'u'lláh's position had caused Him to be spared. But in 1852 when two crazed young Bábís made an attempt to kill the Sháh, Bahá'u'lláh was imprisoned for four months in the Síyáh Chál, a dreadful underground prison in Tihrán. Bahá'u'lláh 's innocence was clearly proven in the courts. But this incident is of <a name="viii"></a> great historic significance because during the imprisonment Bahá'u'lláh became aware that He was the Promised One foretold by the Báb.

	Immediately after being released from prison, He was exiled to Baghdád by the Persian government, in an effort to remove from the country the last effective leader of the detested new faith. Bahá'u'lláh was an exile in 'Iráq for about ten years. During this time He transformed the outlook and character of the followers of the Báb. His own fame spread to such an extent that scholars and men of renown visited Him in increasing numbers.

	To this first exile period belong two of Bahá'u'lláh 's most famous books. One is a very small book of penetrating meditations entitled <i>Hidden Words</i>. In <span style="background-color: #ffffCC" TITLE="pointed saying tersely expressed">epigrammatic</span> sentences, each prefaced by a salutation, Bahá'u'lláh restated the essential spiritual truths which have been taught by the Founders of all the world religions. No complicated theology mars the directness of the passages. It is the voice of God speaking directly to the heart of man.

	<a name="ix"></a>The other outstanding work of this period was the <i>Kitáb-i-Íqán</i>, the English subtitle of which is the "Book of Certitude." This book is one of the major keys to understanding the teachings of Bahá'u'lláh. The great theme is this: in every age God reveals His will and purpose for human destiny through a chosen individual or Manifestation. Religion thus progressively evolves. The spiritual aspects of man's relation to God are not changed from age to age but restated and clarified. The social part of religion undergoes changes in every age because the conditions of life change. Thus Moses made certain laws which Jesus later changed or ignored, to the horror of the priests and the orthodox. The evolutionary principle in world religion is Bahá'u'lláh's first challenging contribution to the spiritual unity of mankind. A generous selection from the <i>Íqán</i> concerning the "City of Certitude" is found on pages <a href="p003-346.html#p264">264</a>-270.

	The Muslim priests and the Turkish and Persian governments as Islamic church-states could not tolerate the rebirth of the new faith under Bahá'u'lláh. So it was decreed that Bahá'u'lláh be exiled from Baghdád to Constantinople, on the theory that distance would dissipate His influence - a theory repeatedly tried and repeatedly bringing opposite results. In 1863 the exile was ordered. And in the few days while a caravan was being prepared for the long journey, Bahá'u'lláh announced to His followers that He was the One Whose coming the Báb foretold.

	After being four months in Constantinople, Bahá'u'lláh was banished to Adrianople. He here publicly proclaimed His message, addressing collectively <a name="x"></a>the temporal and spiritual rulers of the earth. He wrote some of the first of a series of letters known collectively as the "Tablets to the Kings." He addressed the Sultán of Turkey, the Sháh of Persia, and Napoleon III, Emperor of the French. Among the themes in these letters was a call to the rulers "to be just and vigilant, to compose their differences and reduce their armaments." Later He addressed such letters to Queen Victoria, Alexander II of Russia, Pope Pius IX, William I, the Emperor of Germany, and Francis Joseph, the Emperor of Austria. In His book of laws the <i>Kitáb-i-Aqdas</i>, Bahá'u'lláh addressed a passage to "the Rulers of America and the Presidents of the Republics therein," asking them to "adorn the temple of dominion with the ornament of justice" and bidding them "bind with the hands of justice the broken." A few selections from this series of Tablets are in this volume, on pages <a href="p003-346.html#p122">122</a>-125, <a href="p003-346.html#p210">210</a>-212, <a href="p003-346.html#p219">219</a>-232, <a href="p003-346.html#p232">232</a>-240, and <a href="p003-346.html#p246">246</a>-249.

	The chief principle of Bahá'u'lláh's teachings is "the oneness and wholeness of the human race." This is the pivotal point of all that He taught. The purpose of the Bahá'í Faith is to unite the entire world in one common faith and one common social order. We may perhaps state that Bahá'u'lláh's second challenging contribution to the unity of the human race is a set of principles and a social structure designed to produce justice. He called justice "the best beloved of all things" in the sight of God. He urged moderation and warned against fanaticism and excesses of all kinds. The acquiring of education is essential to everyone. True religion and science are in agreement. Consultation is the key method for the settling of disputes and for developing plans and policies for the common good.  <a name="xii"></a>To achieve the unity of the human race was Bahá'u'lláh's compelling life purpose.

	The aim of religion is to produce the strong, intangible bonds of unity. Bahá'u'lláh clarifies the historic development of religion as the evolution of one faith, serving different needs in each age. Abraham, Moses, Buddha, Zoroaster, Krishna, Jesus, Muhammad, the Báb, and Bahá'u'lláh have been successive Manifestations, through Whom God has progressively revealed the purpose of religion. Because of ignorance, the followers of these Manifestations may quarrel, but the open-minded individual can see the pattern of agreement and evolution in what these supreme Educators taught. Stripped of the many layers of theology and custom, the different faiths of the world assume an integrated relationship, each leading to the other in historic development, as links in a chain. And none of the great Founders of the world's religions has ever taught that He was the only or the last Revealor of divine teachings. Instead, Each of them has praised the Prophet Who lived and taught before Him, and also has pointed to the future when another such Educator, or "Spirit of Truth" as Jesus taught, would live.

	This very briefly summarizes the story which is so intimately associated with the spirit of <i>Gleanings</i>. The reader may be further assisted by the fact that the contents of <i>Gleanings</i> may be divided into five parts. Part one, pages <a href="p003-346.html">1</a>-46, proclaims this age as the "Day of God." "The advent of such a Revelation hath been heralded in all the sacred Scriptures." This is the culminating age when the past dispensations will bear fruit as men and women the world over unite in a common faith. Part two, pages <a href="p003-346.html#XIX">46</a>-136, concerns the Manifestation of God and the significance of the Manifestation in representing the attributes of God. Part three, pages <a href="p003-346.html#LXX">136</a>-200, deals with basic questions concerning the soul and its immortality. Part four, pages <a href="p003-346.html#XCIX">200</a>-259, concerns spiritual aspects of World Order and the Most Great Peace. Part five, pages <a href="p003-346.html#CXXII">259</a>-346, deals with the duties of the individual and the spiritual meaning of life. Bahá'u'lláh's teachings may be further studied in <i>Bahá'í World Faith</i> and in other translations of His writings. The most detailed history of the Faith is <i>God Passes By</i> written by Shoghi Effendi.

	<i>Gleanings</i> is a book for meditative study. It is not a book of history and facts, but of love and spiritual power. No one can understand the faith of the thousands of martyred followers of the Báb, unless he catches the spirit of this book. No one can appreciate why thousands of Bahá'ís give up the comfort of settled homes and move into strange countries to tell the <a name="xvi"></a>people about Bahá'u'lláh, unless he clearly glimpses the spirit of this book.

	Bahá'u'lláh has called into being a constantly-growing body of followers in the five continents of the globe. These people come from differing racial and religious backgrounds. In the Faith of Bahá'u'lláh they become united in belief and action. While wars are waged and the moral fabric of modern civilization becomes more and more tattered, Bahá'ís continue to tell the story of Bahá'u'lláh's life, of the reawakening of men to the call of God in our time. For, to Bahá'ís, quite literally, "This is the changeless faith of God, eternal in the past, eternal in the future." While the rot of modern materialism does its deadly work, Bahá'ís continue to patiently sacrifice and work to build the group consciousness and the social institutions which Bahá'u'lláh promised them would, in time, flower into a world civilization. To a Bahá'ís, religion encompasses all of life - it is civilization itself. "All men have been created to carry forward an ever-advancing civilization."

	<small><b><i>Editorial Note:</i> Before his passing in 1957, Shoghi Effendi appointed twenty-seven Hands of the Cause of God charged with the propagation and protection of the Faith. Through their efforts the election of the first Universal House of Justice was called in April 1963. At that time this supreme administrative institution of the Bahá'í Faith was elected by the fifty-six existing national administrative bodies (National Spiritual Assemblies), in accordance with provisions in the Writings of Bahá'u'lláh. Through a series of global teaching plans, begun in 1953, the Faith has spread to 165 independent nations and 44 dependent territories, with some 135 National Spiritual Assemblies.
