The great theme is this: in every age God reveals His will and purpose for human destiny through a chosen individual or <a class="hh" title="The great Prophets of God, His chosen Messengers, who appear in each age. The Manifestations of God are not God descended to earth, but are rather perfect reflections of His attributes, just as a mirror reflects the sun but is not the sun itself.

With each dispensation social evolution has advanced, as the scope of man's sense of loyalty to a group has become wider--from the family to the clan, tribe, city-state, nation and ultimately to the recognition of the oneness of mankind, the distinguishing feature of the Revelation of Bahá'u'lláh" href="../../../CLUG/UnifiedGlossary.html#ProgressiveRevelation">progressive</a>ly evolves.

	Bahá'u'lláh has called into being a constantly-growing body of followers in the five continents of the globe. These people come from differing racial and religious backgrounds. In the Faith of Bahá'u'lláh they become united in belief and action.
