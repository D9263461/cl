	Thus have We recounted unto you the tales of the one true God, and sent down unto you the things He had preordained, that haply ye may ask forgiveness of Him, may return unto Him, may truly repent, may realize your misdeeds, may shake off your slumber, may be roused from your heedlessness, may atone for the things that have escaped you, and be of them that do good.  Let him who will, acknowledge the truth of My words; and as to him that willeth not, let him turn aside.  My sole duty is to remind you of your failure in duty towards the Cause of God, if perchance ye may be of them that heed My warning. Wherefore, hearken ye unto My speech, and return ye to God and repent, that He, through His grace, may have mercy upon you, may wash away your sins, and forgive your trespasses.  The greatness of His mercy surpasseth the fury of His wrath, and His grace encompasseth all who have been called into being and been clothed with the robe of life, be they of the past or of the future.

However, the chief locus of divine attributes in this world are the Manifestations of God who exemplify most perfectly all God's attributes. Many Bahá'í prayers end with a list of some of the attributes, or names, of God." href="../../../CLUG/UnifiedGlossary.html#AttributesofGod">attribute</a> to mankind, such power is <a name="p142"></a>released as can generate, through successive ages, all the manifold arts which the hands of man can produce. This, verily, is a certain truth.  No sooner is this resplendent word uttered, than its animating energies, stirring within all created things, give birth to the means and instruments whereby such arts can be produced and perfected.  All the wondrous achievements ye now witness are the direct consequences of the Revelation of this Name.  In the days to come, ye will, verily, behold things of which ye have never heard before.  Thus hath it been decreed in the <a class="hh" title="A sacred epistle containing a revelation" href="../../../CLUG/UnifiedGlossary.html#Tablet">Tablet</a>s of God, and none can comprehend it except them whose sight is sharp.  In like manner, the moment the word expressing My attribute "The Omniscient" issueth forth from My mouth, every created thing will, according to its capacity and limitations, be invested with the power to unfold the knowledge of the most marvelous <a class="hh" title="In the Bahá'í teachings, the study of sciences must have as its goal the welfare and benefit of mankind" href="../../../CLUG/UnifiedGlossary.html#Science">science</a>s, and will be empowered to manifest them in the course of time at the bidding of Him Who is the Almighty, the All-Knowing. Know thou of a certainty that the Revelation of every other Name is accompanied by a similar <a class="hh" title="The great Prophets of God, His chosen Messengers, who appear in each age. The Manifestations of God are not God descended to earth, but are rather perfect reflections of His attributes, just as a mirror reflects the sun but is not the sun itself.

	<a name="LXXVII"/><span style="background-color: #ffffCC" TITLE="Section 77 (Lawh-i-Khalíl)">LXXVII</span>. And now, concerning thy question regarding the creation of man.  Know thou that all men have been created in the nature made by <a class="hh" title="The deity. Bahá'ís believe there is only one God, unknowable in His essence, who is the creator and absolute ruler of the universe" href="../../../CLUG/UnifiedGlossary.html#God">God</a>, the Guardian, the Self-Subsisting.  Unto each one hath been prescribed a pre-ordained measure, as decreed in God's mighty and <a class="hh" title="Guarded or Preserved Tablet. Occurs only once in Qur'án, 85:21–22: ''It is a glorious Qur'án written on the preserved table.'' (The plural of lawh, alvah, occurs in Qur'án 7:142 concerning the tables of the law, of Moses). Nicholson, Commentary on the Mathnawí, I, 85, says ''the heavenly Lawh-i-Mahfúz on which all things are recorded from eternity to everlasting.'' BW V, 491 says this ''denotes the Knowledge of God and of His Manifestation.''" href="../../../CLUG/UnifiedGlossary.html#Lawh-i-Mahfúz">guarded Tablets</a>.  All that which ye potentially possess can, however, be manifested only as a result of your own volition.  Your own acts testify to this truth.  Consider, for instance, that which hath been forbidden, in the <a class="hh" title="('Exposition') is the title given by the Báb to His Book of Laws, and it is also applied to the entire body of His Writings. The Persian Bayán is the major doctrinal work and as Shoghi Effendi has written, 'should be regarded primarily as a eulogy of the Promised One rather than a code of laws and ordinances designed to be a permanent guide to future generations.' The Arabic Bayán is parallel in content but smaller and less weighty" href="../../../CLUG/UnifiedGlossary.html#Bayán">Bayán</a>, unto men.  God hath in that Book, and by His behest, decreed as lawful whatsoever He hath pleased to decree, and hath, through the power of His sovereign might, forbidden whatsoever He elected to forbid. To this testifieth the text of that Book.  Will ye not bear witness?  Men, however, have wittingly broken His <a class="hh" title="Commandments of God revealed by the Manifestations. There are two degrees of law: eternal laws, spiritual in nature, which never alter, such as the law requiring man to acknowledge and worship God; and social laws particular to the Dispensation, such as the law forbidding the eating of pork in the time of Moses. Both are divine in origin and must be obeyed, but succeeding Manifestations may change or modify the social laws espoused by previous Manifestations" href="../../../CLUG/UnifiedGlossary.html#LawofGod">law</a>.  Is such a behavior to be attributed to God, or to their proper selves?  Be fair in your judgment. Every good thing is of God, and every <a class="hh" title="'Evil' is explained in the Bahá'í Writings as being the absence of good, in the same way that darkness is the absence of light. Evil is not seen as an independent force in its own right" href="../../../CLUG/UnifiedGlossary.html#Evil">evil</a> thing is from yourselves.  Will ye not comprehend?  This same <a name="p150"></a>truth hath been <a class="hh" title="The Unveiling by God of the laws, teachings or message transmitted through His Manifestations to mankind which hitherto He had hidden from them" href="../../../CLUG/UnifiedGlossary.html#Revelation">revealed</a> in all the Scriptures, if ye be of them that understand.  Every act ye meditate is as clear to Him as is that act when already accomplished. There is none other God besides Him.  His is all creation and its empire.  All stands revealed before Him; all is recorded in His holy and hidden <a class="hh" title="A sacred epistle containing a revelation" href="../../../CLUG/UnifiedGlossary.html#Tablet">Tablet</a>s. This fore-knowledge of God, however, should not be regarded as having caused the actions of men, just as your own previous knowledge that a certain event is to occur, or your desire that it should happen, is not and can never be the reason for its occurrence.

Whatsoever in the contingent world can either be expressed or apprehended, can never transgress the limits which, by its inherent nature, have been imposed upon it.  God, alone, transcendeth such limitations.  He, verily, is from everlasting.  No peer or partner has been, or can ever be, joined with Him.  No name can be compared with His Name.  No pen can portray His nature, neither can any tongue depict His glory.  He will, for ever, remain immeasurably exalted above any one except Himself.

Behold how the thing which thou hast seen in thy dream is, after a considerable lapse of time, fully realized.

The world beyond is as different from this world as this world is different from that of the child while still in the womb of its mother.  When the soul attaineth the Presence of God, it will assume the form that best befitteth its immortality and is worthy of its celestial habitation.  Such an existence is a contingent and not an absolute existence, inasmuch as the former is preceded by a cause, whilst the latter is independent thereof.  Absolute existence is strictly confined to God, exalted be His glory.  Well is it with them that apprehend this truth.  Wert thou to ponder in thine <a class="hh" title="The symbolic centre of an individual's spirituality" href="../../../CLUG/UnifiedGlossary.html#Heart">heart</a> the behavior of the Prophets of God thou wouldst assuredly and readily testify <a name="p158"></a>that there must needs be other worlds besides this world.  The majority of the truly wise and learned have, throughout the ages, as it hath been recorded by the <a class="hh" title="The power of the Holy Spirit manifested through Bahá'u'lláh's writings" href="../../../CLUG/UnifiedGlossary.html#AbháPen">Pen of Glory</a> in the <a class="hh" title="Tablet of Wisdom, by Bahá'u'lláh (Holy Land), setting forth ''the fundamentals of true philosophy.''

Even the materialists have testified in their writings to the <a class="hh" title="Knowledge; the ability to discern inner qualities and relationships, insight; good judgement. Bahá'u'lláh writes: 'Above all else, the greatest gift and the most wondrous blessing hath ever been and will continue to be wisdom'" href="../../../CLUG/UnifiedGlossary.html#Wisdom">wisdom</a> of these divinely-appointed Messengers, and have regarded the references made by the Prophets to Paradise, to <a class="hh" title="Heaven and Hell are the highest and lowest conditions a human soul can experience. In the Bahá'í Writings these terms are used in a spiritual rather than a literal, material sense. These conditions of 'heaven' and 'hell' are not limited to life after death. 'Heaven' is the state of perfection and nearness to God, achieved by a soul who has striven to acquire virtues during its life on earth, while 'hell' is the condition of imperfection, remoteness and the awareness of the deprivation one has brought by one's actions. Bahá'u'lláh explains in the Kitáb-i-Íqán that the use of the word 'heaven' in earlier prophecies such as the 'cleaving asunder of the heaven' is metaphorical not literal" href="../../../CLUG/UnifiedGlossary.html#HeavenandHell">hell</a> fire, to future reward and punishment, to have been actuated by a desire to educate and uplift the souls of men.  Consider, therefore, how the generality of mankind, whatever their beliefs or theories, have recognized the excellence, and admitted the superiority, of these Prophets of God.  These Gems of Detachment are acclaimed by some as the embodiments of wisdom, while others believe them to be the mouthpiece of God Himself.  How could such Souls have consented to surrender themselves unto their enemies if they believed all the worlds of God to have been reduced to this earthly life?  Would they have willingly suffered such afflictions and torments as no man hath ever experienced or witnessed?

The Great Being, wishing to reveal the prerequisites of the peace and tranquillity of the world and the advancement of its peoples, hath written: The time must come when the imperative necessity for the holding of a vast, an all-embracing assemblage of men will be universally realized.  The rulers and kings of the earth must needs attend it, and, participating in its deliberations, must consider such ways and means as will lay the foundations of the world's <a class="hh" title="''It can be concluded that humanity has three processes ahead of itself: the Lesser Peace, the Great Peace and the Most Great Peace...''

Such a peace demandeth that the Great Powers should resolve, for the sake of the tranquillity of the peoples of the earth, to be fully reconciled among themselves. Should any king take up <a class="hh" title="Bahá'u'lláh forbid the use of any kind of arms or weapon in His Dispensation" href="../../../CLUG/UnifiedGlossary.html#Weapons">arms</a> against another, all should unitedly arise and prevent him.  If this be done, the nations of the world will no longer require any armaments, except for the purpose of preserving the security of their realms and of maintaining internal order within their territories.  This will ensure the peace and composure of every people, <a class="hh" title="One of the laws of Bahá'u'lláh is that Bahá'ís must obey the laws of the government of the land in which they live. They are forbidden to take part in subversive movements" href="../../../CLUG/UnifiedGlossary.html#Government,Obedienceto">government</a> and nation.  We fain would hope that the kings and rulers of the earth, the mirrors of the gracious and almighty name of <a class="hh" title="The deity. Bahá'ís believe there is only one God, unknowable in His essence, who is the creator and absolute ruler of the universe" href="../../../CLUG/UnifiedGlossary.html#God">God</a>, may attain unto this station, and shield mankind from the onslaught of tyranny. ...The day is approaching when all the peoples of the world will have adopted one <a class="hh" title="The establishment of an international language to be taught in all the schools of the world, in addition to the native tongue, is ordained by Bahá'u'lláh in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas and mentioned in various Tablets.

'We have enjoined upon the Trustees of the House of Justice either to choose one language from among those now existing or to adopt a new one, and in like manner to select a common script, both of which should be taught in all the schools of the world. Thus will the earth be regarded as one country and one home.'  In one of His Tablets, Bahá'u'lláh praises the Arabic language for its expressiveness and eloquence, and remarks that no other language can match its vast possibilities. He further states that God would be pleased if all the peoples of the world were to speak the Arabic language" href="../../../CLUG/UnifiedGlossary.html#Language,UniversalAuxiliary">universal language</a> <a name="p250"></a>and one common script.  When this is achieved, to whatsoever city a man may journey, it shall be as if he were entering his own home.  These things are obligatory and absolutely essential.  It is incumbent upon every man of insight and understanding to strive to translate that which hath been written into reality and action. ...That one indeed is a man who, today, dedicateth himself to the <a class="hh" title="Helpful or useful act, helping others. To become a servant of God, one must serve mankind" href="../../../CLUG/UnifiedGlossary.html#Service">service</a> of the entire human race.  The Great Being saith:  Blessed and happy is he that ariseth to promote the best interests of the peoples and kindreds of the earth.  In another passage He hath proclaimed:  It is not for him to pride himself who loveth his own country, but rather for him who loveth the whole world.  The earth is but one country, and mankind its citizens.
