	   We, the two billion people currently on the planet, are living at a time when not only the pulpits of all the religions, but all things must be condemning us, each in that voice which, according to the Qur'án, God has given to all things: "God, Who giveth a voice to all things, hath given us a voice...." (41:20). We who have killed some forty-five million human beings in the past thirty-five years, strangers whom we did not even know by name. We who have denied our qualitative difference from the animals and have tried to live in their world, an attempt which has proved as successful as would be the animal's to turn into a tree or the tree's to be a stone. We who spend our time devising elaborate excuses to justify our ways; who always blame someone else, who always want someone else to save us.

At His advent we fight Him and resist Him, whether He is Moses or Buddha, Jesus or Muhammad, or Bahá'u'lláh.

	   Man is showing by his acts that he has lost God and in consequence has also lost himself. "And be ye not like those," the Qur'án warns, "who forget God, and whom He hath therefore caused to forget their own selves." (59:19). Man is bewildered--straying in a wilderness. He must find the meaning in the universe again, and this meaning is God as expressed by the Prophet; then he will rediscover his own self, the reflection of the meaning; then he will have a way of life in keeping with the facts and will consciously follow it.

	   A seventeen year old boy is referred to in this book. He was a troublesome youth and his father was worried about him. Then Bahá'u'lláh, imprisoned in the barracks at 'Akká, summoned him. Following their interview, the boy, alone and on foot, carried to Persia Bahá'u'lláh's Tablet to the Sháh. He reached the capital after a four months' journey; he fasted, prayed, and waited on a rock until he saw the Sháh and his suite going hunting in the direction of the hill villages north of Tihrán. He approached them and called out in Arabic: "O King! I have come to thee from Sheba with a weighty message." (This is what the lapwing said to Solomon when it returned from seeing Balkis on her golden throne: Qur'án 27:22.) The Tablet was taken from the boy and delivered to the priests. They read it, and recommended that the boy be put to death. The executioners branded him with hot irons for three days; a photograph, taken of him under torture, is extant. Then they beat his head to a pulp with a rifle butt and threw his body down a hole.

	   Bahá'u'lláh wrote, in a Tablet to the boy's father--Hájí 'Abdu'l-Majid, who himself was to suffer martyrdom later on in Khurásán: <i>"Dost thou think that he is dead? No, by the Revealer of Signs! Through him the spirit of life joyfully moveth in the hearts of the universe.</i>" In this same Tablet, Bahá'u'lláh says that in Badí' "<i>the spirit of might and power was breathed</i>"; that he was created anew; that he smiled, and "<i>should We have commanded him, he would have subdued all in heaven and upon the earth.</i>" That "<i>Joy overtook him,</i>" and that he went to his death "<i>with power and authority, advancing with such strength as to overturn the Supreme Concourse and the denizens of the Cities of Names.</i>"

	   The point is that Badí' was recreated. He was in Bible terminology born again. He saw the truth and died as a sacrifice to it. Those who believe in Baha'u'llah today are seldom called to join the ranks of the more than 20,000 who gave up their lives in the Heroic Age of His Cause--who, as the present text states, "<i>threw down the precious crown of life for the sake of Him Who is the Incomparable Friend.</i>" But they are repeatedly obliged to disregard their own likes and dislikes, to discipline their conduct, to win a victory over their own selves--a process longer, less spectacular, and perhaps more painful than martyrdom.

	   The thinking world has caught up, by now, with the basic teachings which Bahá'u'lláh (1817–1892) enunciated more than seventy years ago. Today no enlightened mind can disagree with such Bahá'í fundamentals as these: "The oneness and wholeness of the human race." (This is the most vital of them all, the establishment of this principle being the central purpose of the Bahá'í Faith. The unification of mankind is, Bahá'u'lláh says, inevitable, and marks the last stage in the evolution of man toward maturity.) Service to humanity the worthiest of all endeavors. Religion, "<i>the chief instrument of the establishment of order in the world,</i>" to be taught to children in all schools in such a way as not to produce fanaticism or prejudice. All religions are essentially one, differing in their outer aspects only because they appeared at different periods in history and thus addressed themselves to varying situations. The reconciliation of religion and science, which are the two most powerful forces in human life. Education available to all. Equal opportunities for both sexes, equality for women being directly linked to world peace. A world federal system, reduction in national armaments, collective security. The adoption of an international auxiliary language and script. Work for all.

	   Bahá'u'lláh states that justice is "<i>the best beloved of all things,</i>" and its advent inevitable. That consultation, frank and unfettered, is "<i>the bestower of understanding,</i>" and the bedrock of His Order. That the acquisition of knowledge is incumbent on everyone, "<i>arts, crafts and sciences</i>" being extolled. That wealth gained through crafts and professions is praiseworthy. That poverty will disappear, as will exorbitant wealth. That the trustees of the "House of Justice" are to legislate on all matters not expressly set forth in Bahá'í writings (this international Bahá'í body is empowered to rescind its previous legislation and to incorporate into its machinery whatever is considered necessary to keep the Faith "in the forefront of all progressive movements."). Constitutional government, combining "the ideals of republicanism and the majesty of kingship" is recommended. Agriculture is to be given special regard. The press is specifically extolled, newspapers being described as "<i>the mirror of the world</i>" and those responsible for their production directed to free themselves from "malice, passion, and prejudice, to be just and fair-minded, to be painstaking in their inquiries and ascertain all the facts in every situation." Bahá'u'lláh further reemphasizes the ban on the waging of holy war and the destruction of books; requires of His followers that they obey the Government of the country in which they live; and singles out for special praise individuals of learning and wisdom whom He describes as "<i>eyes</i>" to the body of mankind.<sup>*</sup>

	   What the world does not yet guess at is the capacity of Bahá'u'lláh's projected world order, functioning in the universal recognition of one God, to "re-create society." The world community is His primary concern. Religion has often, in the past, produced the good individual. The primary object of Bahá'u'lláh's religion is to produce the good society. His administrative system offers, Bahá'ís believe, the only satisfactory arrangement between individual and community, between free will and authority, equilibrating the prerogatives of each.

	   This balance will have to be created if humanity is to develop an age of peace. We have seen the dictator state crushing out the individual, and we have seen lynch law flouting the group. The point has been debated down the ages. Rúmí the mystic begs God to deliver him from his free will, a burden which he says even heaven and the angels refused, and only man accepted; he compares himself to a camel with pack sores, whose <span style="background-color: #ffffCC" TITLE="A basket, especially one of a pair carried by a beast of burden.">panniers</span> sag first on one side and then on the other, and asks that the ill-balanced load be taken from him, and that instead he be made to roll here and there like a polo ball. In contrast with such a view was the way of life in Calvin's Geneva, where according to laws regulating inns, no one was permitted "to sit up after nine o'clock at night, except spies."

Obviously, both individual and group will have to give up something of what they now have, just as the nations will have to yield some of their present sovereignty in favor of the world commonwealth, but this will prove no more of a hardship than the sacrifice of bait to catch fish.

	   Here is a world religion to match the new world. It has no priesthood; it accepts no funds except from registered adherents. It has solved the problems of successorship, administration and schism, factors which virtually destroyed, almost at their inception, the unity of all previous faiths. In this case Bahá'u'lláh the Founder Himself designated in His written Covenant that His eldest son 'Abdu'l-Bahá was His authorized Successor and Interpreter. Abdu'l-Bahá in His own Will and Testament appointed as Guardian and Interpreter His grandson Shoghi Effendi, who in turn is to appoint the next Guardian, the written appointment to be ratified by vote of a council of "Hands of the Cause." The democratically-elected institutions which in conjunction with the Guardian administer the Faith were likewise stipulated in the writings of the Founder. The present task of Bahá'ís the world over is two-fold, involving both consolidation in studying the Teachings and practicing the Bahá'í way of life--and expansion: presenting this Faith to the public for free investigation. Bahá'í communities are now to be found in more than one hundred countries around the globe.

	   Study of the writings is a lifetime occupation. Although the tenets of the Faith are readily grasped, the Teachings are vast, disclosing new horizons as the individual's experience develops. It is far from true that all Bahá'ís are intellectuals--there are communities of Persian villagers--but it is certain that the Teachings themselves and the effort to bring them before the public act as a strong incentive to acquire diversified knowledge. 'Abdu'l-Bahá writes, "The dominion of kings has an ending...but the sovereignty of science is everlasting..." and again, "All blessings are divine in origin but none can be compared with this power of intellectual investigation and research which is an eternal gift producing fruits of unending delight... All other blessings are temporary; this is an everlasting possession."

	   Some three months after this text was finished, Bahá'u'lláh expressed His wish to leave the world. He was now living, still an exile and prisoner as He had been, here and there throughout the Middle East, for the previous forty years, in the Mansion of Bahjí outside 'Akká. From this time on it became clear from the tone of His remarks, although He made no open reference to it, that the end of His life on earth was approaching. Years before, He had described in His Tablet of the Vision--revealed on the anniversary of His Forerunner and Prophet-Herald, the martyred Báb--how the white-clad "<i>Luminous Maid</i>" had appeared before Him and urged Him to hasten to His "<i>other dominions,</i>" dominions "<i>whereon the eyes of the people of names have never fallen.</i>" Now a few more months passed, until after a brief illness He died at dawn, on May 29, 1892, in the seventy-fifth year of His age.

To evade the debt, he denounced them as followers of the Báb. He knew exactly what this would mean.

Then Shaykh Muhammad-Báqir, whom Bahá'u'lláh names "The Wolf," pronounced their death sentence. The Prince-Governor, Zillu's-Sultán, eldest son of the Sháh, ratified it. The brothers were chained. Their heads were severed. Their bodies were dragged to the great open square of the city, and there they were exposed to every indignity the mob could inflict.

As for his accomplice Mír Muhammad-Husayn, Bahá'u'lláh stigmatized him as the "She-Serpent," and declared him to be "<i>infinitely more wicked than the oppressor of Karbilá.</i>" This man was expelled from Isfahán, wandered from one village to another, and finally sickened and died of a disease so foul-smelling that his own wife and daughter could not bear to attend him.

Hippolyte Dreyfus, distinguished scholar and traveler, the first French Bahá'í, had met him in Persia, visiting him in his tent when the prince was on a hunting trip. Now he saw him again, on the terrace of the hotel. M. Dreyfus described the meeting to Juliet Thompson, who arrived the following day, and she has recorded it in her diary: "The Master too was on the terrace, pacing up and down at a little distance. Hippolyte was standing in the doorway when he saw Zillu's-Sultán coming up the steps. The prince approached and greeted him, then turned a startled look toward the Master. 'Who is that Persian nobleman?' he asked. 'That,' answered Hippolyte, 'is Abdu'l-Bahá.' And now Zillu's-Sultán spoke very humbly. 'Take me to Him,' he begged. Hippolyte told me all about it. 'If you could have seen the brute, Juliet, mumbling out his miserable excuses! But the Master took him in His arms and said, 'All those things are in the past. Never think of them again.' "

A Muslim cleric of Isfahán, he and his pupils kicked and trampled the corpse of Mírzá Ashraf, still another Bahá'í who, in 1888, was killed by order of the mullás of that city. He is often addressed in this text as "O Shaykh!"--this being a title denoting a chief, <span style="background-color: #ffffCC" TITLE="A high-ranking member of the clergy.">prelate</span> or man of learning. Other persons are also called upon in the course of the work; the people of the Bayán--those followers of the Báb who failed to recognize Bahá'u'lláh, reminiscent of those followers of John the Baptist who failed to acknowledge Jesus Christ, are addressed. And Hádí, a religious leader terrified of losing his rank when he was called a disciple of the Báb, and who tried to destroy every copy of the Bayán, the Báb's great book. And the Wolf himself, in passages quoted from the "Tablet of the Proof," and Queen Victoria and Napoleon III and others, in quoted passages. Although the Tablet is primarily directed to the Son of the Wolf he seems almost incidental; Bahá'u'lláh is, rather, speaking beyond him to all humanity.

	   Some of the terminology will be familiar only to students of Islámics, for the Bahá'í Faith comes out of Islám as Christianity comes out of Judaism. <a name="HillAndHaram"/>For example the Arabic verse on <a href="p001-182.html#p17">p. 17</a> contrasts the Sanctuary (Haram), the sacred place where no blood may be shed, with the place outside the Sanctuary (Hill) where the shedding of blood is not unlawful, and refers to Bahá'u'lláh's willingness to sacrifice His life anywhere and under any conditions. Or there is reference to the <a name="Sadratu'l-Muntahá"/>Sadratu'l-Muntahá. This is the "Divine Lote-Tree," the "Sidrah Tree, which marks the boundary," the "Lote-Tree of the extremity," the "Tree beyond which neither men nor angels can pass," and which stands in the Seventh Heaven, the highest Paradise, at the right hand of the Throne of God. Reference to it occurs obliquely in Qur'án 53:9 and directly in 53:14, and the two visions there described are traditionally related to Muhammad's Vision of the Ascension or Mi'ráj (cf. Súrih 17:1). In Bahá'í writings this Tree symbolizes the Prophet or Manifestation of God.

	   Balál, great, early believer in Muhammad, was an Ethiopian slave. Cruelly tortured by the idolatrous Meccans, he refused to recant his faith in Islám.

The reference on <a href="p001-182.html#p76">p. 76</a> is to the fact that because of his affliction he pronounced the letters "sh" as "s."

The hamstringing of the She-Camel goes back to Qur'án 7:71; 11:67; 54:27, etc. The She-Camel was a sign of God, the proof of the Prophet Sálih's mission.

In Islám he is the discoverer and custodian of the water of life, and symbol of the True Guide. Rukn is the Black Stone set in the wall of the Ka'bih, the cube-shaped building at Mecca which is the chief object of pilgrimage of the Muslim world. The Maqám or Station of Abraham is near the Ka'bih. Cf.

That the promises of previous Faiths as to the advent of the Day of God have at last been redeemed.

	   <i>Editorial Note</i>: Prior to his passing in 1957, Shoghi Effendi appointed twenty-seven Hands of the Cause of God charged with the propagation and protection of the Faith. Through their efforts the election of the first Universal House of Justice was called in April 1963. At that time this supreme administrative institution of the Bahá'í Faith was elected by the fifty-six existing national administrative bodies, in accordance with provisions in the Writings of Bahá'u'lláh. Through a series of global teaching plans, begun in 1953, the Faith has spread to 166 independent countries and 48 significant territories and islands. [1987]
