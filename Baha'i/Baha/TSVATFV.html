How many a day he found no rest in longing for her; how many a night the pain of her kept him from sleep; his body was worn to a sigh, his heart's wound had turned him to a cry of sorrow.  He had given a thousand lives for one taste of the cup of her presence, but it availed him not.  The doctors knew no cure for him, and companions avoided his company; yea, physicians have no medicine for one sick of love, unless the favor of the beloved one deliver him.<p>

His feet carried him on, the one bleeding with the arrow of love, and his heart lamented.  Then he came to a garden wall, and with untold pain he scaled it, for it proved very high; and forgetting his life, he threw himself down to the garden.<p>

For the watchman was Gabriel, guiding this poor one; or he was Isráfíl, bringing life to this wretched one!"<p>
