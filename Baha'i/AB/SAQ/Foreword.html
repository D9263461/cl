	Can we know God? Is there a God? Can religious teaching be reconciled with scientific knowledge? What does it mean to be human? These are questions that once were considered exclusively the province of philosophers and theologians. But no more. In our time they are public domain. Our distressed and bewildered civilization, cut loose from the beliefs and values that sustained it for centuries, totters on the brink of self-destruction. We, the individuals in it, experience loss of the meaning and purpose in life that our ancestors took for granted. Today these questions beg for answers.

	<i>Some Answered Questions</i> addresses, in a charming, succinct, and logical manner, not only questions about God and the relationship between science and religion but a wide range of questions certain to be of interest to the soul in search of religious truth as well as to the inquisitive, scientific mind. The answers come from 'Abdu'l-Bahá, son of the Prophet-Founder of the Bahá'í Faith, a new and independent world religion with followers in virtually every country. The answers were compiled from a series of talks He gave at table during 1904, 1905, and 1906. In each of the five sections of the book 'Abdu'l-Bahá expounds questions ranging from the metaphysical to the matter-of-fact. On the one hand, He reaches into the philosophical realm to discuss topics such as immortality, predestination, free will, and the erroneous doctrine of reincarnation-always treading the mystical path with practical feet. On the other hand, He speaks to questions concerning the <a name="px"></a>organization of human society-questions such as the problem of strikes, the treatment of criminals, and the proper relations between capital and labor-infusing these ordinarily secular matters with spiritual significance.

	In the opening section of <i>Some Answered Questions</i> 'Abdu'l-Bahá uses both logical and traditional proofs to establish the existence of God and the necessity of Divine Educators or Manifestations of God. He devotes several talks to the lives and accomplishments of some of these Divine Manifestations, including Abraham, Moses, Christ, Muhammad, the Báb, and Bahá'u'lláh, seeing each as a successive link in God's unfolding plan for mankind's education. Thus He sheds new light on religious history and on the nature of religion itself. 'Abdu'l-Bahá returns to the theme of Manifestations of God in the third section of the book, where He elucidates in greater detail the character, station, and powers of the unique Beings chosen to act as God's spokesmen.

	In the second section of <i>Some Answered Questions</i> 'Abdu'l-Bahá presents the Bahá'í point of view on a number of knotty Christian subjects. He gives particular attention to the issue of the "return" or Second Coming of Christ. He also examines the birth of Christ, the Resurrection, baptism, the meaning of the eucharist, the miracles of Christ, and the Trinity in a manner that readers schooled in traditional Christian doctrine are sure to find startlingly fresh and illuminating.

	In the fourth section of the book 'Abdu'l-Bahá considers the origin, powers, and conditions of man. The Bahá'í affirmation of an underlying harmony and agreement between science and religion comes alive in His explanation of the origin and development of the human species. The book's fifth and final section is devoted to miscellaneous subjects, including discussions of the grounds of human knowledge and of pantheism.

	<i>Some Answered Questions</i>, in style and structure, is unlike <a name="pxi"></a>'Abdu'l-Bahá's other works. His <i>Will and Testament</i>, written in three sections, provides the authority for the Administrative Order of the Bahá'í Faith and ensures its integrity and unity. <i>The Secret of Divine Civilization</i> is a treatise on the general state of modern civilization. <i>A Traveler's Narrative</i> chronicles the early history of the Bábí and Bahá'í Faiths. <i>Memorials of the Faithful</i> contains 'Abdu'l-Bahá's remembrances of seventy-nine early Bahá'ís, all bound by their love for Bahá'u'lláh. Only <i>Some Answered Questions</i>, shaped as it is from questions put to Him over meals, affords the reader essays on a variety of themes--each of which can be read either at one sitting as an individual topic for study and reflection, or as part of a whole that emerges from the collection of talks. Most of the talks are short. All bear the marks of conversation. All use lucid, concrete illustrations to clarify difficult topics. Humor relieves the serious. At every turn a "brilliant simplicity," "persuasiveness," and "force" illuminate the fundamentals and the fine points of Bahá'í belief.

	The Bahá'í Faith was founded by Mírzá Husayn 'Alí (1817-1892), known as Bahá'u'lláh, the "Glory of God." The Bahá'í Faith's origins are intimately linked with the Bábí Faith, founded in Persia (Írán) in 1844 by Mírzá 'Alí-Muhammad (1819-1850), known as the Báb, or "Gate." The Báb announced that He was not only the founder of an independent religion, but the herald of a new and far greater prophet or messenger of God, Who would usher in an age of peace for all mankind. In 1863 Bahá'u'lláh declared that He was the One prophesied by the Báb.

	Bahá'u'lláh's teachings quickly brought Him into conflict with the Persian government and the Muslim clergy, and He was exiled from Írán to various places within the Ottoman Empire. In 1868 He was sent as a prisoner to the fortress city of Akká in the Holy Land, in the vicinity of which He passed away in 1892. In His will <a name="pxii"></a>He appointed 'Abdu'l-Bahá (1844-1921), His eldest son, to succeed Him in leading the Bahá'í community and in interpreting the Bahá'í writings. 'Abdu'l-Bahá in turn appointed His eldest grandson, Shoghi Effendi (1897- 1957), as His successor, the Guardian of the Cause and authorized interpreter of the Bahá'í teachings. Today the affairs of the Bahá'í world community are administered by The Universal House of Justice, the supreme elected council of the Bahá'í Faith.

	The central teachings of the Bahá'í Faith are the oneness of God, the oneness of religion, and the oneness of mankind. The fundamental principles proclaimed by Bahá'u'lláh are that religious truth is not absolute but relative; that Divine Revelation is a continuous and progressive process; that all the great religions of the world are divine in origin; and that their missions represent successive stages in the spiritual evolution of human society. Since Bahá'u'lláh teaches that the purpose of religion is the promotion of concord and unity and that religion is the foremost agency for the achievement of peace and orderly progress in society, the Bahá'í writings provide the outline of institutions necessary for the establishment of peace and world order. These include a world federation or commonwealth, with executive, legislative, and judiciary arms; an international auxiliary language; a world economy; a mechanism for world intercommunication; and a universal system of currency, weights, and measures.

	The Bahá'í writings also provide specific guidance that helps Bahá'ís (followers of Bahá'u'lláh) fulfill the basic purpose of human life-knowing and worshiping God and "carrying forward an ever-advancing civilization"-while they strive to bring about the unity of mankind, world peace, and world order. For example, the Bahá'í writings call for the fostering of a good character and the development of spiritual qualities such as honesty, <a name="pxiii"></a>trustworthiness, compassion, and justice. These are achieved through prayer, meditation, and work done in the spirit of service to humanity-all expressions, for Bahá'ís, of the worship of God. In the pursuance of the Bahá'í principle of the organic oneness of humanity, the Bahá'í writings call for the eradication of prejudices of race, creed, class, nationality, and sex. They call for the systematic elimination of all forms of superstition hampering human progress and the achievement of a balance between the material and spiritual aspects of life, both of which rest on an understanding of the principles of an unfettered search for truth and of the harmony of science and religion as two facets of truth. They encourage the development of the unique talents and abilities of every individual, through the pursuit of knowledge and the acquisition of skills, for the practice of a trade or profession is required not only for personal satisfaction but also for the enrichment of society as a whole. They call for the full participation of both men and women in all aspects of community life, including the elective and administrative processes and decision-making, in implementation of the Bahá'í principle of equal opportunities, rights, and privileges for both sexes. They call for the fostering of the principle of universal compulsory education.

	<i>Some Answered Questions</i> has appeared in a number of editions since it was first published in London in 1908. It continues to be one of the most popular and eagerly sought after works in the growing literature of the Bahá'í Faith. More important, the book has assumed a significant place in the sacred literature of the Faith, being one of the very few compilations of 'Abdu'l-Bahá's utterances authenticated by 'Abdu'l-Bahá Himself. This new edition once more makes readily available a priceless resource for the student of the Bahá'í teachings and for the seeking soul.

	THE talks between 'Abdu'l-Bahá and Laura Clifford Barney took place during the difficult years, 1904-1906, when He was confined to the city of 'Akká by the Turkish government and permitted to receive only a few visitors. At the time He was under constant threat of removal to a distant desert confinement.

	As interlocutor, Miss Barney arranged for one of 'Abdu'l-Bahá's sons-in-law, or for one of the three distinguished Persians of His secretariat of that period, to be present during the talks to insure accuracy in recording His replies to the questions asked Him. 'Abdu'l-Bahá later read the transcriptions, sometimes changing a word or a line with His reed pen. They were later translated into English by Miss Barney The original Persian texts are today a part of the Bahá'í archives of Haifa. For additional commentary on this work, refer to Shoghi Effendi's statements in <i>God Passes By</i>, pages 107, 260, 268, 305 and 383.

	As it was on this day, so it continued; between the hours of work, His fatigue would find relief in renewed activity; occasionally He was able to speak at length; but often, even though the subject might require more time, He would be called away after a few moments; again, days and even weeks would pass, in which He had no opportunity of instructing me. But I could well be patient, for I had always before me the greater lesson-the lesson of His personal life.

	During my several visits to 'Akká, these answers were written down in Persian while 'Abdu'l-Bahá spoke, not with a view to publication, but simply that I might have them for future study. At first they had to be adapted to the verbal translation of the interpreter; and later, when I had acquired a slight knowledge of Persian, to my limited vocabulary. This accounts for repetition of figures and phrases, for no one has a more extensive command of felicitous expressions than 'Abdu'l-Bahá. In these lessons He is the teacher adapting Himself to His pupil, and not the orator or poet.

	Originally they were not given in any special order, but have now been roughly classified for the convenience of the reader. The Persian text has been closely followed, at times even to the detriment of the English, a few alterations being made in the translation merely where the literal rendering seemed too involved and obscure; and the interpolated words, required to make the meaning clearer, have not been indicated in any way in order to avoid the too frequent interruption of the thought by technical or explanatory signs. Also many of the Persian and Arabic names have been written in their simplest form without strictly adhering to a scientific system which would be confusing to the average reader.
