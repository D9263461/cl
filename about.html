<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>

Welcome to <i>The Covenant Library</i>.
The purpose of this project is to bring Baha'i literature to the HTML format.

<p>
This library is designed for reference purposes.
To that end, the works are hyperlinked not only internally in each volume, but also to each other, in order to make it easier to find references.

<p>
The presentation of the books is unusual in that the main text appears on the left, and items relating to the main text appear on the right side of each page.
This allows the reader to read the main text of the book in an HTML browser, uninterrupted by footnotes or other items.

<p>
Items <span style="background-color: #ffffCC" TITLE="emphasized or made prominent">highlighted</span> can be hovered over for a quick definition.  For best results of this function, please use desktop versions of Firefox or Chrome browsers.

<p>
Many thanks to the friends who have proof-read the contents of this library to ensure the integrity of the works contained therein.

<p><b>
Many friends have asked for the ability to download all the books in this library for off-line use...I have asked the publishers for this permission but have not been able to secure it. Therefore, the only way to access this library is on-line at this time.  If the situation changes, I will eagerly provide a link for the download of the entire library for off-line use.
