While in America He spoke at a Woman's Suffrage Meeting in New York, stating: 'In past ages it was held that woman and man were not equal--that is to say, woman was considered inferior to man, even from the standpoint of her anatomy and creation. She was considered especially inferior in intelligence, and the idea prevailed universally that it was not allowable for her to step into the arena of important affairs. In some countries man went so far as to believe and teach that woman belonged to a sphere lower than human. But in this century, which is the <a class="hh" title="The twentieth century, so designated by 'Abdu'l-Bahá in a Tablet known as Seven Candles of Unity: '...the unity of all mankind can in this day be achieved.

Of this past ages have been deprived, for this century--the century of light--has been endowed with unique and unprecedented glory, power and illumination.'" href="#CenturyofLight">Century of Light</a> and the <a class="hh" title="The Unveiling by God of the laws, teachings or message transmitted through His Manifestations to mankind which hitherto He had hidden from them" href="#Revelation">revelation</a> of mysteries, God is proving to the satisfaction of humanity that all this is ignorance and error; nay, rather, it is well established that mankind and womankind as parts of composite humanity are coequal and that no difference in estimate is allowable, for all are human. The conditions in past centuries were due to woman's lack of opportunity. She was denied the right and privilege of <a class="hh" title="That process which enables a person to understand God, the Manifestation, and his own self, as well as to acquire particular skills and knowledge useful to himself and to the world" href="#Education,Natureof">education</a> and left in her undeveloped state.

The one whose <a class="hh" title="The symbolic centre of an individual's spirituality" href="#Heart">heart</a> is pure is acceptable in His sight, be that one man or woman. God does not inquire, ''Art thou woman or art thou man?'' He judges human actions. If these are acceptable in the threshold of the Glorious One, man and woman will be equally recognized and rewarded. Furthermore, the education of woman is more necessary and important than that of man, for woman is the trainer of the child from its infancy. If she be defective and imperfect herself, the child will necessarily be deficient; therefore, imperfection of woman implies a condition of imperfection in all mankind, for it is the mother who rears, nurtures and guides the growth of the child. This is not the function of the father. If the educator be incompetent, the educated will be correspondingly lacking. This is evident and incontrovertible. Could the student be brilliant and accomplished if the teacher is illiterate and ignorant? The mothers are the first educators of mankind; if they be imperfect, alas for the condition and future of the race...The world of humanity consists of two parts: male and female. Each is the complement of the other. Therefore, if one is defective, the other will necessarily be incomplete, and perfection cannot be attained. There is a right hand and a left hand in the human body, functionally equal in <a class="hh" title="Helpful or useful act, helping others. To become a servant of God, one must serve mankind" href="#Service">service</a> and <a class="hh" title="Colloquial term used by Bahá'ís to refer to the whole Administrative Order of the Bahá'í Faith.

If either proves defective, the defect will naturally extend to the other by involving the completeness of the whole; for accomplishment is not normal unless both are perfect. If we say one hand is deficient, we prove the inability and incapacity of the other; for single-handed there is no full accomplishment. Just as physical accomplishment is complete with two hands, so man and woman, the two parts of the social body, must be perfect. It is not natural that either should remain undeveloped; and until both are perfected, the happiness of the human world will not be realized.'}

It is also spoken natively in the Tajik variety by a significant population within Uzbekistan, as well as within other regions with a Persianate history in the cultural sphere of Greater Iran. It is written officially within Iran and Afghanistan in the Persian alphabet, a derivation of the Arabic script, and within Tajikistan in the Tajik alphabet, a derivation of the Cyrillic script. Historically it has been natively known as Parsi. However, because of Arab conquest, the name Farsi began to emerge, since Arabs could not pronounce P as a sound, since the Arabic language has no P sound. As such, the name Farsi became more prominent. Modern Persian is a continuation of Middle Persian, an official language of the Sasanian Empire (224–651 CE), itself a continuation of Old Persian, which was used in the Achaemenid Empire (550–330 BCE). It originated in the region of Pars (Persia) in southwestern Iran. Its grammar is similar to that of many European languages. Throughout history, Persian was considered prestigious by various empires centered in Western Asia, Central Asia, and South Asia. New Persian literature was first recorded in the ninth century, after the <a class="hh" title="Follower of Islám." href="#Muslim">Muslim</a> conquest of Persia, since then adopting the Perso-Arabic script. Persian was the first language to break through the monopoly of Arabic on writing in the Muslim world, with Persian poetry becoming a tradition in many eastern courts. It was used officially as a language of bureaucracy even by non-native speakers, such as the <a class="hh" title="Bahá'u'lláh wrote: ''The day is approaching when the Land of Mystery (Adrianople), and what is beside it shall be changed, and shall pass out of the hands of the king...''.

It was never intended, however, that the followers of Bahá'u'lláh should stand idly by and make no defence of their lives. Justice is one of the most important teachings in this Dispensation and the believers have used every lawful means to protect themselves against the onslaughts of enemies. This attitude must not be confused with pacifism which is not in conformity with Bahá'í Teachings.

It was considered preferable that she should not know reading or writing in order that she might not be informed of events in the world. Woman was considered to be created for rearing children and attending to the duties of the household. If she pursued educational courses, it was deemed contrary to chastity; hence women were made prisoners of the household...Bahá'u'lláh destroyed these ideas and proclaimed the <a class="hh" title="One of the principles or tenets of Bahá'í social teaching. Bahá'u'lláh has stated: 'Praised be God, the Pen of the Most High hath lifted distinctions from between His servants and handmaidens and...hath conferred upon all a station and rank on the same plane.' " href="#EqualityofMenandWomen">equality of man and woman</a>. He made woman respected by commanding that all women be educated, that there be no difference in the <a class="hh" title="That process which enables a person to understand God, the Manifestation, and his own self, as well as to acquire particular skills and knowledge useful to himself and to the world" href="#Education,Natureof">education</a> of the two sexes and that man and woman share the same rights.

One whose thought is pure, whose education is superior, whose scientific attainments are greater, whose deeds of philanthropy excel, be that one man or woman, white or coloured, is entitled to full rights and recognition; there is no differentiation whatsoever." One Bahá'í <a class="hh" title="A term used for those fundamental tenets of Bahá'í social teaching excerpted from the Writings of Bahá'u'lláh and expounded by 'Abdu'l-Bahá during His talks in Europe and America in 1911–13" href="#Principles,Bahá'í">principle</a> which demonstrates the high status of women is that women have priority of education over men: "...the education of woman is more necessary and important than that of man, for woman is the trainer of the child from its infancy...The mothers are the first educators of mankind; if they be imperfect, alas for the condition and future of the race..." "Devote ye particular attention to the school for girls, for the greatness of this wondrous Age will be manifested as a result of progress in the world of women." One result of providing women with an education is that peace will be established: "War and its ravages have blighted the world; the education of woman will be a mighty step toward its abolition and ending, for she will use her whole influence against war. She will refuse to give her sons for <a class="hh" title="To give up, suffer the loss of, or renounce something for the sake of God, an ideal or belief. 'Ultimately, in its highest sense, self-sacrifice means to give our will and our all to God to do with as He pleases. Then He purifies and glorifies our true self until it becomes a shining and wonderful reality'" href="#Sacrifice">sacrifice</a> upon the field of battle. In truth, she will be the greatest factor in establishing <a class="hh" title="A condition of permanent peace and world unity, signalizing mankind's coming of age,  fulfilling the promises of the past concerning the establishment of the 'Kingdom of the Father', a reign of sustained peace on earth, and the Golden Age of the Bahá'í Era" href="#Peace,MostGreat">universal peace</a> and international arbitration. Assuredly, woman will abolish warfare among mankind." The Bahá'í Faith does not teach that men and women are the same, but rather that they have different but equal qualities which complement each other. One of the major obstacles to peace is that the qualities of the female are not fully realized in the world at large: "...men and women have basic and distinct qualities. The solution provided in the teachings of Bahá'u'lláh is not...for men to become women, and for women to become men. <a class="hh" title="The 'Servant of Bahá', the eldest son and appointed Successor of Bahá'u'lláh, and the Centre of His Covenant (1844-1921)" href="#'Abdu'l-Bahá">'Abdu'l-Bahá</a> gave us the key to the problem when He taught that the qualities and functions of men and women 'complement' each other. He further elucidated this point when He said the "new age" will be "an age in which the masculine and feminine elements of civilization will be more properly balanced."}
