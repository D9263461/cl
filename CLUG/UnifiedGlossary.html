		There is no implication of faith being blind; faith must be balanced by knowledge: "Regarding the 'two wings' of the <a class="hh" title="The inner and essential reality of man which is not composed of physical matter and thus continues to exist after death" href="#Soul">soul</a>: These signify wings of ascent. One is the wing of knowledge, the other of faith, as this is the means of the ascent of the human soul to the lofty station of divine perfections." "If <a class="hh" title="Religion has two main purposes: the personal spiritual development of the individual and to establish order in the world. Bahá'u'lláh writes, 'Religion is verily the chief instrument for the establishment of order in the world and of tranquillity amongst its peoples.' 'Should the lamp of religion be obscured, chaos and confusion will ensue, and the lights of fairness and justice, of tranquillity and peace cease to shine.'" href="#Religion">religion</a> is opposed to reason and science, faith is impossible; and when faith and confidence in the divine religion are not manifest in the <a class="hh" title="The symbolic centre of an individual's spirituality" href="#Heart">heart</a>, there can be no spiritual attainment."

There are two degrees of law: eternal laws, spiritual in nature, which never alter, such as the law requiring man to acknowledge and worship God; and social laws particular to the Dispensation, such as the law forbidding the eating of pork in the time of Moses.

The first is objective faith that is expressed by the outer man, obedience of the limbs and senses. The other faith is subjective, and unconscious obedience to the will of God...This condition of unconscious obedience constitutes subjective faith. But the discerning faith that consists of true knowledge of God and the comprehension of divine words, of such faith there is very little in any age." 
		Faith is personal and must be personally cultivated.

It is not possible to describe God.

Far be it from His glory that human tongue should adequately recount His praise, or that human heart comprehend His fathomless mystery. He is, and hath ever been, veiled in the ancient eternity of His Essence, and will remain in His Reality everlastingly hidden from the sight of men."

It is one of man's purposes in this life to acquire and refine these attributes and virtues.

Industries will be established and various institutions of philanthropic nature will be founded. The flowers of civilization and culture from all nations will be brought here to blend their fragrances together and blaze the way for the brotherhood of man. Wonderful gardens, orchards, groves and parks will be laid out on all sides. At night the great city will be lighted by electricity. The entire harbour from 'Akká to Haifa will be one path of illumination. Powerful searchlights will be placed on both sides of <a class="hh" title="One of the sacred spots in Bahá'í history, where are the Shrine of the Báb, memorials to members of 'Abdu'l-Bahá's family, and site of the Bahá'í World Centre" href="#Carmel,Mount">Mount Carmel</a> to guide the steamers.

It was considered preferable that she should not know reading or writing in order that she might not be informed of events in the world. Woman was considered to be created for rearing children and attending to the duties of the household. If she pursued educational courses, it was deemed contrary to chastity; hence women were made prisoners of the household...Bahá'u'lláh destroyed these ideas and proclaimed the equality of man and woman. He made woman respected by commanding that all women be educated, that there be no difference in the education of the two sexes and that man and woman share the same rights. In the estimation of God there is no distinction of sex. One whose thought is pure, whose education is superior, whose scientific attainments are greater, whose deeds of philanthropy excel, be that one man or woman, white or coloured, is entitled to full rights and recognition; there is no differentiation whatsoever." 
		One Bahá'í <a class="hh" title="A term used for those fundamental tenets of Bahá'í social teaching excerpted from the Writings of Bahá'u'lláh and expounded by 'Abdu'l-Bahá during His talks in Europe and America in 1911–13" href="#Principles,Bahá'í">principle</a> which demonstrates the high status of women is that women have priority of education over men: "...the education of woman is more necessary and important than that of man, for woman is the trainer of the child from its infancy...The mothers are the first educators of mankind; if they be imperfect, alas for the condition and future of the race..." "Devote ye particular attention to the school for girls, for the greatness of this wondrous Age will be manifested as a result of progress in the world of women." 
		One result of providing women with an education is that peace will be established: "War and its ravages have blighted the world; the education of woman will be a mighty step toward its abolition and ending, for she will use her whole influence against war. She will refuse to give her sons for <a class="hh" title="To give up, suffer the loss of, or renounce something for the sake of God, an ideal or belief.

In truth, she will be the greatest factor in establishing universal peace and international arbitration. Assuredly, woman will abolish warfare among mankind."
		The Bahá'í Faith does not teach that men and women are the same, but rather that they have different but equal qualities which complement each other. One of the major obstacles to peace is that the qualities of the female are not fully realized in the world at large: "...men and women have basic and distinct qualities. The solution provided in the teachings of Bahá'u'lláh is not...for men to become women, and for women to become men. <a class="hh" title="The 'Servant of Bahá', the eldest son and appointed Successor of Bahá'u'lláh, and the Centre of His Covenant (1844-1921)" href="#'Abdu'l-Bahá">'Abdu'l-Bahá</a> gave us the key to the problem when He taught that the qualities and functions of men and women 'complement' each other.
