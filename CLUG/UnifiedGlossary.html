Many religious traditions describe this unfulfilled longing as a ''God-shaped hole'' in the human heart that can only be filled by God. Attempting to fill this void with material possessions, success, relationships, or pleasure is often compared to drinking saltwater--it only intensifies the thirst. God is the universal source of ''living water''. God's provision for spiritual fulfillment is offered to everyone. ''If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink'' (John 7:37) is a universal invitation to all men, regardless of their background or past.

Many religious traditions describe this unfulfilled longing as a ''God-shaped hole'' in the human heart that can only be filled by God. Attempting to fill this void with material possessions, success, relationships, or pleasure is often compared to drinking saltwater--it only intensifies the thirst. God is the universal source of ''living water''. God's provision for spiritual fulfillment is offered to everyone. ''If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink'' (John 7:37) is a universal invitation to all men, regardless of their background or past. Jesus states (John 4) that anyone who drinks the ''living water'' he offers ''will never thirst again''" href="#Thirst">thirsted</a> for this wondrous Day.

Nevertheless...if the mirror is destroyed or ceases to exist, no harm will happen to the bounty of the sun, which is everlasting.

The conditions in past centuries were due to woman's lack of opportunity. She was denied the right and privilege of <a class="hh" title="That process which enables a person to understand God, the Manifestation, and his own self, as well as to acquire particular skills and knowledge useful to himself and to the world" href="#Education,Natureof">education</a> and left in her undeveloped state.

God does not inquire, ''Art thou woman or art thou man?'' He judges human actions. If these are acceptable in the threshold of the Glorious One, man and woman will be equally recognized and rewarded. Furthermore, the education of woman is more necessary and important than that of man, for woman is the trainer of the child from its infancy. If she be defective and imperfect herself, the child will necessarily be deficient; therefore, imperfection of woman implies a condition of imperfection in all mankind, for it is the mother who rears, nurtures and guides the growth of the child. This is not the function of the father. If the educator be incompetent, the educated will be correspondingly lacking. This is evident and incontrovertible. Could the student be brilliant and accomplished if the teacher is illiterate and ignorant? The mothers are the first educators of mankind; if they be imperfect, alas for the condition and future of the race...The world of humanity consists of two parts: male and female. Each is the complement of the other. Therefore, if one is defective, the other will necessarily be incomplete, and perfection cannot be attained.

If we say one hand is deficient, we prove the inability and incapacity of the other; for single-handed there is no full accomplishment. Just as physical accomplishment is complete with two hands, so man and woman, the two parts of the social body, must be perfect. It is not natural that either should remain undeveloped; and until both are perfected, the happiness of the human world will not be realized.'}<p>

It is written officially within Iran and Afghanistan in the Persian alphabet, a derivation of the Arabic script, and within Tajikistan in the Tajik alphabet, a derivation of the Cyrillic script.

However, because of Arab conquest, the name Farsi began to emerge, since Arabs could not pronounce P as a sound, since the Arabic language has no P sound. As such, the name Farsi became more prominent. Modern Persian is a continuation of Middle Persian, an official language of the Sasanian Empire (224–651 CE), itself a continuation of Old Persian, which was used in the Achaemenid Empire (550–330 BCE). It originated in the region of Pars (Persia) in southwestern Iran. Its grammar is similar to that of many European languages. Throughout history, Persian was considered prestigious by various empires centered in Western Asia, Central Asia, and South Asia. New Persian literature was first recorded in the ninth century, after the <a class="hh" title="Follower of Islám." href="#Muslim">Muslim</a> conquest of Persia, since then adopting the Perso-Arabic script.
